"Secure Sustainable Together The Future of Petrochemicals Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisersThe Future of Petrochemicals Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisersINTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY The IEA examines the full spectrum of energy issues including oil, gas and coal supply and demand, renewable energy technologies, electricity markets, energy efficiency, access to energy, demand side management and much more. Through its work, the IEA advocates policies that will enhance the reliability, affordability and sustainability of energy in its 30 member countries, 7 association countries and beyond. The four main areas of IEA focus are: n Energy Security: Promoting diversity, efficiency, flexibility and reliability for all fuels and energy sources; n Economic Development: Supporting free markets to foster economic growth and eliminate energy poverty; n Environmental Awareness: Analysing policy options to offset the impact of energy production and use on the environment, especially for tackling c",chunk_0

From the cars we drive to the food on our plates, the products and materials we derive from petrochemicals are fundamental to many aspects of modern society. Plastics and fertilisers, the two largest groups of chemical sector products, are indispensable in our everyday lives. Plastics is the fastest-growing group of bulk Page | 3 materials in the world, and synthetic nitrogen fertilisers underpin nearly half the world’s food production. The manufacture of petrochemicals and their derivatives absorbs an increasing proportion of the world’s oil and gas – approximately 14% (13 million barrels per day [mb/d]) for oil and 8% (300 billion cubic metres [bcm]) for gas. Because much of this energy enters the petrochemicals sector as feedstock and does not undergo combustion, the sector achieves the seemingly contradictory feat of being both the largest industrial energy consumer and yet only the third-largest industrial carbon dioxide (CO ) emitter. Even so, with the market for petrochemical 2 products set to expand further as the global economy develops,",chunk_2
"ngly contradictory feat of being both the largest industrial energy consumer and yet only the third-largest industrial carbon dioxide (CO ) emitter. Even so, with the market for petrochemical 2 products set to expand further as the global economy develops, the future of the petrochemicals industry is of major significance for both global energy security and the environment. This International Energy Agency (IEA) analysis explains the circumstances of the petrochemicals industry today and projects how it might develop to 2050. Using the IEA Reference Technology Scenario, the projections are first made based on established trends. Then, a path to a sustainable future is drawn for the industry, one consistent with the UN Sustainable Development Goals – the Clean Technology Scenario. The trajectory of the chemical sector in the Reference Technology Scenario implies a rate of growth in oil demand that is higher than that of any other sector. Of the nearly 10 mb/d growth in total oil demand projected for 2030, the chemical sector is on course to account for more than a third. The sector also plays a significant role in the total growth in gas demand, where it accounts for 7% of the roughly 850 bcm global increase by 2030.

"ical sector is on course to account for more than a third. The sector also plays a significant role in the total growth in gas demand, where it accounts for 7% of the roughly 850 bcm global increase by 2030. Because of this robust growth in fossil fuel consumption, direct CO emissions from the sector 2 increase by around 20% by 2030 and 30% by 2050. Similar deleterious rises occur in air pollutants and water demand. Perhaps most alarmingly, without drastic improvements in the management of waste stemming from the sector’s key material output – plastics – the quantity of plastic waste, including that entering the oceans, continues to rise from today’s already unacceptable levels. An alternative future for petrochemicals – one in which plastics and fertilisers, in particular, are produced more sustainably – is entirely feasible. In this pathway, traced in the Clean Technology Scenario, the petrochemical industry makes the necessary contributions to realising the UN goals. Our analysis concludes by identifying two priority areas for those committed to carrying out this vital transition, along with specific actions to be taken in each.

"s of the modern energy system, including solar panels, wind turbine blades, batteries, thermal insulation for buildings, and electric vehicle parts. Already a major component of the global energy system, the importance of petrochemicals is growing even more. Demand for plastics – the most familiar of petrochemical products – has outpaced all other bulk materials (such as steel, aluminium or cement), nearly doubling since the start of the millennium. The United States, Europe, and other advanced economies currently use up to 20 times as much plastic and up to 10 times as much fertiliser as India, Indonesia, and other developing economies on a per capita basis, underscoring the huge potential for growth worldwide. Feedstocks fly under the radar. Chemicals produced from oil and gas make up around 90% of all raw materials, which are known as feedstocks; the rest comes from coal and biomass. About half of the petrochemical sector’s energy consumption consists of fuels used as raw materials to provide the molecules to physically construct products. … and have become the fastest-growing source of oil consumption The growing role of petrochemicals is one of the key “blind spots” in the global energy debate.

"physically construct products. … and have become the fastest-growing source of oil consumption The growing role of petrochemicals is one of the key “blind spots” in the global energy debate. The diversity and complexity of this sector means that petrochemicals receive less attention than other sectors, despite their rising importance. Petrochemicals are rapidly becoming the largest driver of global oil consumption. They are set to account for more than a third of the growth in oil demand to 2030, and nearly half to 2050,1 ahead of trucks, aviation and shipping. At the same time, currently dominant sources of oil demand, especially passenger vehicles, diminish in importance thanks to a combination of better fuel economy, rising public transport, alternative fuels, and electrification. Petrochemicals are also poised to consume an additional 56 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas by 2030, equivalent to about half of Canada’s total gas consumption today. Countries, including the People’s Republic of China2 and the United States, will see the largest near-term capacity additions; longer-term growth is led by Asia and the Middle East.

"the United States, will see the largest near-term capacity additions; longer-term growth is led by Asia and the Middle East. The United States is expected to increase its global market share for ethylene (steam cracking) to 22% by 2025, up from 20% in 2017. Along with the Middle East, the United States has a feedstock advantage in its access to low-cost ethane owing to its abundant natural gas supplies. This advantage allows both regions to gain the lion’s share of ethane-based chemical exports in the short and medium term. Coal-based methanol-to-olefins capacity in China nearly doubles between 2017 and 2025, providing the material inputs for its large domestic manufacturing base. In the longer run, Asia and the Middle East both increase their market share of high-value chemical production by 10 percentage points, while the share coming from Europe and the United States decreases. By 2050, India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East together account for about 30% of global ammonia production. 1 Please visit the International Energy Agency (IEA) website for more information on the modelling underlying this publication. 2 Hereafter, “China”.The Future of Petrochemicals © OECD/IEA 2018 Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers The combination of a growing globa",chunk_28

Although substantial increases in recycling and efforts to curb single-use plastics take place, especially led by Europe, Japan and Korea, these efforts will be far outweighed by the sharp increase in developing economies of plastic consumption (as well as its disposal). The difficulty in finding alternatives is another factor underpinning the robust overall demand growth for petrochemical Page | 12 products. An evolving landscape for both petrochemical and oil and gas industries Increasing global competition in the industry is driven by new supply dynamics for chemical feedstocks.

"d States has returned to prominence as a low-cost region for chemical production thanks to the shale gas revolution. Today, the United States is home to around 40% of the global capacity to produce ethane-based petrochemicals. Led by Saudi Arabia and Iran, the Middle East remains the low-cost champion for key petrochemicals, with a host of new projects announced across the region. China and Europe each account for around a quarter of the global capacity for naphtha-based, high-value chemicals, but they have only very small shares of capacity based on lighter feedstocks because of limited availability. China’s burgeoning coal-based chemical industry, once a speculative proposition, now embodies steady technological improvements. India is poised to grow strongly from its current level of only 4% of global capacity to satisfy increasing domestic demand. Oil companies are increasingly pursuing integration along the petrochemical value chain. Against a backdrop of slower gasoline demand growth, robust growth prospects for chemical products, and attractive margins, oil companies are further strengthening their links with petrochemical markets.

" for chemical products, and attractive margins, oil companies are further strengthening their links with petrochemical markets. New, direct crude-oil-to-chemicals process routes may also come into play, offering alternatives to traditional refining/petrochemical operations although the technology remains challenging for now. For example, Saudi Aramco and SABIC have recently announced a large crude-to-chemicals project of 0.4 mb/d, five times the size of the only existing facility in Singapore. The production, use and disposal of chemicals take an environmental toll … Petrochemicals face a number of climate, air quality, and water pollution challenges. Petrochemical products provide substantial benefits to society, including a growing number of applications in various cutting-edge, clean technologies critical to a sustainable energy system. However, the production, use, and disposal of these products pose a variety of sustainability challenges that need to be addressed. Even though the chemical sector consumes roughly as much energy as the steel and cement sectors combined, it emits less CO than either sector.

Still, this amounts to around 1.5 GtCO , 2 2 which is 18% of all industrial-sector CO emissions, or 5% of total combustion-related CO 2 2 emissions. This is in part because the chemical industry consumes more oil and gas than other heavy industries, which tend to rely more on coal. Another contributing factor is that the carbon contained in chemical feedstocks is mostly locked into final products (such as plastics), and it is released only when the products are burned or decompose. … but solutions are achievable and cost-effective In our Clean Technology Scenario (CTS), which provides an ambitious but achievable pathway for the chemical sector, environmental impacts decline across the board. In the CTS, air pollutants from primary chemical production decline by almost 90% by 2050; and water demand is nearly 30% lower than in the base scenario.

Some of the most cost-effective opportunities for CCUS can be found in the chemical sector, which explains its leading role among scalable options for reducing emissions. Catalytic alternatives to traditional process routes can provide more than 15% of energy savings per unit of production. Shifts from coal to natural gas for both ammonia and methanol production, mainly in China, result in decreases in both process emissions and energy intensity. Despite falling investment costs, processes based on electricity and biomass struggle to compete on cost in most regions, due to high prices in a world where these low-carbon energy carriers are in high demand. The surge in the share of lighter oil products required for petrochemical feedstocks may pose challenges for refining in the CTS.

Chemicals and society Chemical products are ubiquitous in modern society. It is unusual to find oneself in a building or vehicle unadorned with plastics, rubber or synthetic textiles, and these materials are intimately engrained in our daily routines: toothbrushes, carrier bags, food packaging, mobile phones, computers, carpets, clothes, furniture… and these are just the items we see every day.

Plastic packaging, much of which is used for food and, increasingly, beverages, is the largest component of single end-use plastic demand, accounting for approximately 36% globally. Page | 16 As people live longer and enjoy increasing standards of living, they are likely to consume more of the products mentioned above. Furthermore, facilitating a more sustainable future relies increasingly on outputs from the chemical sector. For example, reducing the overall weight of vehicles, a strategy pursued to reduce fuel consumption, is supported through the integration of plastic-based materials. Modern insulation materials that reduce the demand for heating and cooling in buildings also have a strong chemical component. As with most dependencies, there is an accompanying burden. Chemical products take an environmental toll, both when produced and after use, by ending up where they ought not to.

" they ought not to. The chemical sector’s final energy consumption, which is the highest of any industrial sector, is mainly composed of fossil fuels. In consuming this energy, the sector releases carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions and air pollutants and contributes to the demand for water for energy. 2 When deposited in waterways, plastics, fertilisers and other products cause damage to marine ecosystems, each in their own way. When fertilisers are applied to fields in excess quantities – or just before a deluge – they can leach, resulting in high nutrient concentrations in nearby rivers and estuaries. This can result in eutrophication, whereby a surge in algae growth deprives all other life of oxygen, leading to suffocation. With plastics, the pathway is more direct, but no less devastating to marine life. Plastics find their way into the oceans when they are inadequately disposed of, transported and processed. They can then be broken down into particles and be ingested by fish.

"ety’s growing dependence on chemicals has been reflected by a steady period of growth in the output of the chemical and petrochemical sector. The production of plastics – one of the sector’s key material outputs – has increased globally by more than tenfold since 1970, faster than the rate of growth of any other group of bulk materials and almost 60% faster than growth of gross domestic product (GDP). Ammonia – a key primary chemical and the chemical base of all nitrogen fertilisers – has seen production increases more in line with those of other energy- intensive sectors, which have each undergone between a three- and sevenfold increase during this period. Since the millennium, bulk materials such as cement, crude steel, and primary aluminium have matched and, in some cases, largely exceeded GDP growth rates, particularly to meet new infrastructure needs in rapidly developing economies such as in the People’s Republic of China (hereafter, “China”). By contrast, there are initial signs of a decoupling between ammonia production and GDP growth, partly because of increasing efficiency in the use of fertilisers.

"onia production and GDP growth, partly because of increasing efficiency in the use of fertilisers. Overall, this strong trajectory of activity growth reflects the relatively late emergence of petrochemicals as an industrial sector and the continuing advance of its associated technology. Some key developments in the chemical sector pre-date the period for which activity data are available. For example, some important industrial chemicals can be traced back to the 18th century (notably sulphuric acid); but many of those most relevant to today’s consumers were not invented or produced at sufficient scale for more than another century. Ammonia was first produced with a practical level of thermodynamic efficiency after the invention of the Haber- Bosch process in 1909, and nitrogen fertiliser, production of which accounts for 80% of ammonia use today, is still synthesised via the Haber-Bosch process.© OECD/IEA 2018 The Future of Petrochemicals Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers Box 1.1 • Chemicals and petrochemicals Modern petrochemistry has its origins in the oil and gas industry.

"etrochemicals Modern petrochemistry has its origins in the oil and gas industry. Petrochemicals are a subset of industrial chemicals, hence the full name of the industrial sector that produces them: the “chemical and petrochemical sector”. In the context of this report, petrochemicals are defined as chemicals derived from petroleum (oil) products, such as ethane and naphtha, or from natural gas. Using this definition, petrochemicals account for 90% of total feedstock demand in chemical production today. Chemicals such as light olefins (ethylene and Page | 17 propylene) and aromatics (benzene, toluene and mixed xylenes [BTX]), typically called “high-value chemicals” (HVCs), are often co-produced in a process such as steam cracking. Demand for HVCs tends to be driven by the consumption of plastics, synthetic fibres and rubber. Ammonia is an example of a chemical that, though it can be produced from oil, is more commonly produced today from natural gas or coal. Methanol, an important industrial alcohol, is similar to ammonia in this regard. The production of “primary chemicals” (the collective term for HVCs, ammonia, and methanol together), accounts for around -two-thirds of total energy demand in the chemical sector.

The partial overlap with the petrochemicals boundary indicates the capacity to produce each of these chemicals both from oil and gas, and from other non-“petro” sources. The petrochemicals listed above can all be technically produced today from a variety of different products and substances, including forms of renewable energy such as biomass, water and CO or other carbon sources. 2 This could potentially lead to the “petro” prefix becoming redundant. However, the vast majority of industrial chemicals use oil, natural gas, or coal both as their input materials and as the sources of energy for fuelling the production processes.

"y are these commodities cheap to procure and process relative to the alternatives, but some atomic building blocks required for chemical products such as plastics and fertilisers (primarily carbon and hydrogen) are present in convenient quantities and arrangements. The first plastic is thought to have been Parkesine, invented by Alexander Parkes in 1856; but the explosion of plastics into mainstream applications did not take place until the second half of the 20th century. A key precursor process to large-scale polymer production – steam cracking – was invented in the early 1900s and proved a critical step on the way to achieving large-scale production of what were to be the most transformational set of materials since the invention of steel alloys. What drives chemical consumption? It is challenging today to imagine a world without plastics and fertilisers. An example of multiple chemical products playing a fundamental role in society is found in the supply chains that underpin modern food production.

Different types of plastics, or “resins”, are used for different purposes, depending on the specification required in the end-use application. Individual types of plastic are usually distinguished by using their Resin Identification Code (see Box 1.2) or by referring to the name of the dominant polymer in their composition. Polymers are chains of individual molecules (called monomers): ethylene is the monomer used to make polyethylene.

Can chemicals be used more efficiently? Several strategies can be pursued to improve the efficiency with which chemicals are used throughout the value chain, thereby providing the same final services while consuming fewer chemicals and chemical products. Widespread deployment of such strategies can reduce overall demand for material. These approaches are often collectively referred to as “material efficiency” strategies. Although many chemicals are gases and liquids (as opposed to durable materials like plastic and steel), the same principles apply (Allwood et al., 2013; Allwood and Cullen, 2012).

"esses provides an efficient way to deploy material exactly where and how it is needed, and many can recycle and utilise “in-house” scrap. • Increasing product lifetimes. This reduces the rate at which products need replacing and, therefore, the cumulative material demand over a given time period. This strategy overlaps to some extent with the re-use of products. • Other strategies, including material substitution and achieving significant behavioural and/or lifestyle changes so as to reduce absolute demand – consuming, moving, and using less. In the chemical sector, plastics constitute the main group of material outputs, although many material efficiency strategies also apply to rubber, synthetic fibre, and other durable products. For chemical products that decompose, dilute or otherwise disperse during use, it is more difficult to intervene to effect material savings. Examples are applying fertiliser to managed soils or using cosmetic and hygiene products delivered as aerosols.

"o for durable products, material efficiency strategies that reduce the need to replace the product are often the most effective starting point. Refilling plastic containers, repairing rubber tyres, and deploying fertilisers efficiently are all examples of strategies that limit the need for recycling. The potential of plastic recycling to reduce the demand for primary chemicals is dependent on the amount and quality of available scrap and on the level of recycling achieved. For several bulk materials in other sectors, recycling rates5 are already high: steel and aluminium around 80% and paper around 60%. The rate of non-fibre plastic recycling is much lower (though the data are much poorer). It is estimated that some 18% of available plastic waste (excluding synthetic fibre) is currently recycled in some form, although the rate of displacement of virgin resins is much lower since much recycling is currently “open loop” (see Box 1.3). The upside of this low recycling rate is, of course, that the potential for increasing plastic recycling is much greater than for several other materials.

"asing plastic recycling is much greater than for several other materials. Today there are two main categories of plastic recycling: mechanical and chemical recycling, with the former being much more widespread. Mechanical, or “back to polymer”, recycling offers a simpler and generally lower cost source of secondary plastic production, in which the chemical structure of the polymers remains intact. Collected and sorted plastic waste is the feed material, which is then cleaned, cut up into chips, and re-melted ready for moulding. Some impurities often remain after cleaning, including various additives used in virgin plastics to yield certain properties. For instance, isophthalic acid is often used as an additive in PET bottles to reduce their crystallinity, thereby improving the clarity and transparency. If the PET resin in the bottle is to be recycled and used for other purposes where this characteristic is no longer required, the additive – often deeply embedded in the chemical 5 The recycling rate is defined here as the collection rate for recycling after initial use.© OECD/IEA 2018 The Future of Petrochemicals Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers structure of the product – can become an inhibiting impurity, rather than a helpful additive.

These impurities can result in lower-performance in recycled materials, relative to their virgin counterparts. The colouring used in virgin plastics presents a further – but mainly aesthetic – challenge. Two plastics of the same chemical composition, but differing colours, are very difficult to separate using existing industrial sorting processes. In mixed waste streams, where thousands of colours of plastics are encountered, the consequence tends to be that resins of multiple Page | 23 colours are recycled together. This often limits the choice of the colour of the final product to black. This sounds trivial, but it has a significant impact on the extent to which recycled material can displace virgin production. Chemical, or “back to monomer”, recycling describes a group of processes in which the plastic waste is converted back to the chemical building blocks that produced the original virgin material.

" of processes in which the plastic waste is converted back to the chemical building blocks that produced the original virgin material. This involves chemical transformations, calling for complex industrial processing equipment, and thus is generally more capital-intensive than is mechanical recycling. The key advantage of chemical recycling is that the quality obtained in secondary plastic production is often equal to that of virgin production, enabling the same product to be recycled many times. The difficulty, though, is that the process economics tend to be less favourable relative to the virgin production routes for the same plastic. As a result this route is not yet followed at an industrial scale globally (Rahimi and García, 2017). Box 1.3 • Material cycles: Circular, open and closed loops A product or material is said to be recycled or reused in a closed loop if it is returned at the end of its initial lifetime in a fit state to fulfil the service for which it was originally produced.

"escribes that which enables a second lifetime for the material used in the original product, but at least some is used to produce a different product from the original. A material or product is described as circular (or exhibiting circularity) if it completes the closed loop without loss. Technically, most products can be returned to their original chemical components. However, few materials or products are circular in today’s supply chains, due to material losses during use and disposal. PET drinks bottles for water and soft drinks are an example of a chemical product that is reused and recycled, but in varying degrees of open and closed loops. To take three of many possible pathways: 1) A drinks bottle can be purchased and re-used multiple times, either directly by the consumer or after return to the vendor for cleaning and re-filling, forming an entirely closed loop on a material basis. Several countries and states (e.g. Germany and California) have incentives in place to encourage consumers to collect and return plastic bottles. These schemes are even more common for glass bottles. 2) The bottle can be sent to a chemical recycling facility where it is broken down into its key chemical building blocks and re-manufactured to form a new bottle from the basic mono",chunk_64
"urn plastic bottles. These schemes are even more common for glass bottles. 2) The bottle can be sent to a chemical recycling facility where it is broken down into its key chemical building blocks and re-manufactured to form a new bottle from the basic monomers. So-called “bottle-to-bottle” recycling is a form of back-to-monomer recycling. 3) Again, the bottle can be returned to a recycling facility, chipped, melted and re-manufactured to form polyester fibre. Fibre is a lower grade end-use of PET, where slightly lower grades of polymer purity can be tolerated relative to food- or bottle-grade resin. This means the recycled product cannot be re-used in its original application. Because of this and the fact that there is no large-scale outlet for recycling PET fibre, even this imperfect recycle loop occurs only once. This type of recycling is often referred to as “downcycling” and is an example of open-loop recycling. Beyond recycling and reuse, other material efficiency strategies are thought to have limited potential when it comes to plastics.

Light-weighting of plastic products is often already carried out to its practical limit. Thinner plastic bottles and carrier bags serve to reduce the amount of plastic required for containing and transporting consumer goods, but further gains are limited by material properties and Page | 24 practicalities. Underpinning the successful deployment of these strategies are effective design principles (e.g. design for disassembly), often supported by regulations.

"environmental constraint, however, in many countries, there is a minimum requirement for the thickness of a plastic bag (typically 40-50 microns), without which they become fragmented in waste streams and difficult to sort and collect. Fertilisers are integral to our modern agricultural systems, improving yields and limiting diseases. But there can be too much of a good thing. “Fertiliser efficiency” is usually defined as increase in yield achieved per unit of fertiliser applied. Because soil conditions and desired crops vary considerably with climate and location, there is no single optimal target value for the amount of fertiliser to be applied. In Western Europe, with respect to nitrogen fertilisers specifically (the most energy-intensive to produce), country studies from the 1990s found that fertiliser application could be reduced by 44%, without nutritional loss, when applied more efficiently (Worrell, Meuleman and Blok, 1995). Between 1987 and 2007, nitrogen fertiliser use per hectare in the European Union declined by more than half; and in China it is estimated that a reduction of 30-50% could take place without reducing crop yields (Good and Beatty, 2011).

Seven chemical building blocks underpin a vast industry Despite the substantial complexity of the chemical sector, only seven primary chemicals – ammonia, methanol, ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, and mixed xylenes – provide the key building blocks on which the bulk of the chemical industry is based. These primary chemicals account for approximately two-thirds of the sector’s total consumption of final energy products. Ammonia (NH ) is the starting compound for all nitrogen-containing fertilisers. At ambient 3 conditions, it is a toxic colourless gas with a pungent smell; but in water solutions, it can be treated without much difficulty. Globally, more than half of ammonia is converted to urea, which is in turn mainly used as a fertiliser, but it also has industrial applications. Ammonia and urea are often produced in integrated or co-located facilities since the large quantity of concentrated CO 2 released during the manufacture of ammonia is used as an input to urea production.

In aggregate, agricultural uses account for approximately 80% of total ammonia demand, but ammonia also serves as a chemical building block in several industrial applications, explosives, and cleaning products. Global ammonia production is approximately 185 million tonnes per year (Mt/yr). Methanol (CH OH) is a light, colourless and odourless liquid that is highly flammable. Methanol is 3 most commonly used to make other chemicals. About 40% is converted to formaldehyde and further processed into plastics, plywood, paints, explosives and textiles. It is also used in anti- freeze, solvents and fuels for vehicles, and it can serve as an energy carrier. Methanol can also be converted to other primary chemicals.

Key production processes HVCs are produced either in multi- or single-product processes in the chemical sector; alternatively, they are sourced as by-products from refinery operations. Ethylene, propylene and BTX aromatics are co-produced in steam crackers. Whereas ethylene is produced almost exclusively in the chemical sector in steam crackers, propylene is sourced in large quantities as a by-product of refining operations, specifically, of fluid catalytic cracking. The majority of BTX aromatics are sourced from FCC and continuous catalytic reforming units in refineries. The dominant processes for producing propylene as a single product are propane dehydrogenation and olefin metathesis. Olefins can also be produced from methanol using the methanol-to-olefins process although this is done only in China, where abundant access to coal sufficiently lowers the cost of producing methanol.

Oil feedstocks, such as naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas and fuel oil, can also be used, either with steam reforming or via a similar route to synthesis gas – partial oxidation. Again, China uniquely uses coal as a feedstock for producing both methanol and ammonia.

Key message • Today, feedstock accounts for just over half of the sector’s energy inputs. Box 2.1 • Chemical feedstock: Energy or material? Whereas the main inputs and outputs to say, the iron and steel sector (iron ore in, steel out) are unequivocally recognised as materials, the same cannot be said of the chemical sector. Chemicals form a bridge between the energy system and consumers’ vehicles, homes and plates. Chemical feedstock consists of molecules of oil, natural gas and other carbon- and hydrogen-containing minerals, which are extracted from the ground and processed to end up physically constituting, for example, the million or so plastic bottles the world currently produced every minute (Laville and Taylor, 2017). Feedstock is also embedded in the synthetic fibre, rubber, detergents and other chemical products we use every day to manufacture packaging, carpets, cars, cutlery, electronic goods, toothbrushes, clothes and a plethora of other consumer goods.

"hemical products we use every day to manufacture packaging, carpets, cars, cutlery, electronic goods, toothbrushes, clothes and a plethora of other consumer goods. We are surrounded by chemical products and, therefore, also by chemical feedstock. At first glance, it appears that feedstock can be consigned to the “material” category. Alas, the picture is more complex. When entering the chemical sector as a fuel, feedstock is measured in energy units and accounted for in energy statistics. This is because, at that point, it is indistinguishable on a molecular level from its process energy counterparts. In other words, it could still be burned to release energy, just like any other fuel. A further complication arises, in that the feedstock can also play a role in the process energy requirements. Some unconverted feedstock in by-products is recirculated and used as fuel inputs. Molecules of feedstock often release energy as they are rearranged and reassembled in the chemical supply chain.

Perhaps the easiest way to consider feedstock is to think of it as akin to wood. Like the oil and gas used for chemical feedstock, wood can be used both as a material and as a fuel. Charcoal and other forms of biomass made from wood appear in energy statistics and are measured in energy units. Conversely, and again like feedstock, timber – a wood product, analogous to plastic – is used to construct buildings and other end-use products, which it would be strange to quantify in energy units (this house contains “ gigajoules” of timber, as opposed to “ tonnes”).

The complexity at the margins in the chemical sector is hard to overstate. The European Chemicals Agency (a regulatory body) tracks more than 100 000 unique substances. Many of these substances are produced using primary chemicals and their derivatives. The total mass of chemical products leaving the chemical sector is larger than the mass of feedstock entering it. This is because in addition to feedstock (mainly composed of carbon and hydrogen), many chemical products contain other elements (mainly oxygen, nitrogen and chlorine) that are added at various points in the supply chain.

The magnitude of these secondary material flows is a key reason why the sector is so energy-intensive. Heating, cooling, moving and separating these substances, in addition to the feedstock and the primary chemicals, consumes large amounts of process energy. Another question is the extent to which these secondary material flows can be re-absorbed in the production of other chemicals, although it is known that this practice is already widespread in some parts of the supply chain. For example, the carbon dioxide (CO ) by-product from ammonia 2 manufacture (process emissions) is used as a raw material input to urea manufacture on a large scale. Although many chemical operations are integrated to achieve a high degree of efficiency in resource use within an individual facility, the full potential for the use of by-products from one process as inputs to another across the industry as a whole is difficult to ascertain.

For each tonne of 2 polyethylene recycled (the most common plastic used in packaging), more than 1 tonne of ethylene demand can be eliminated, saving at least 1.5 tonnes of oil-equivalent (toe). Bio-based feedstock can also displace fossil fuel feedstock or replace derivative chemicals further down the value chain. These alternatives offer promising potential to support the decoupling of chemicals production from CO emissions, in part due to their relatively low current levels of penetration. 2The Future of Petrochemicals © OECD/IEA 2018 Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers Figure 2.3 • Passage of fossil fuel feedstock through the chemical industry in 2017 Page | 30 Notes: All flows in the diagram are sized on a mass basis.

Key message • More than 500 million tonnes of oil-equivalent (Mtoe) of feedstock is consumed per year to make nearly 1 billion tonnes of chemical products. Oil is the dominant feedstock for HVCs, whereas gas and coal are used for ammonia and methanol. Globally in 2017, recycling of major plastic resins is estimated to have reached 16% of available waste, while global production capacity of bio-plastics stood at just over 2 Mt (European Bioplastics, 2018) (the latter equivalent to less than 1% of annual global plastic demand, if fully utilised).

Theoretically, the chemical sector could do without fossil fuels altogether, but feedstock containing carbon and hydrogen will remain a requirement. What determines the selection of feedstock? For much of the history of the chemical industry, primary chemicals could be made only from oil and natural gas. Modern chemistry and industrial processing permits most energy products to be converted into most primary chemicals, either directly or via secondary processing. Ammonia and methanol can be made directly from oil, natural gas, coal, bio-energy, and even water (by splitting water molecules to make hydrogen, although methanol requires a separate source of carbon because none is available in the water molecules). HVCs can be made from oil directly, but also from all the other fuels listed above via methanol.

Methanol-to-olefins (MTO) is now commercial, whereas the more challenging transformation from methanol-to-aromatics is still at the pilot plant stage (Bazzanella and Ausfelder, 2017).© OECD/IEA 2018 The Future of Petrochemicals Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers Despite this innovation and flexibility, not all routes are equally competitive, which explains the dominance of fossil fuels in today’s demand for chemical feedstock. Ethane (North America and the Middle East) and naphtha (Europe and Asia) are the principal feedstocks used to make HVCs, whereas natural gas is the key input for producing methanol and ammonia globally, except in the People’s Republic of China,6 where coal is dominant for both. The overarching consideration in the selection of feedstock and process routes is the production cost, allowing Page | 31 for equipment costs and process yields, though there are also other factors at play, some of which are regional, including feedstock availability, labour costs and the regulatory environment.

"t costs and process yields, though there are also other factors at play, some of which are regional, including feedstock availability, labour costs and the regulatory environment. Process equipment costs, excluding engineering and installation costs, tend to be fairly uniform regionally for a given technology because there are relatively few vendors available and therefore little variation among offerings. However, overall costs vary significantly between the process routes available, which are distinguished, primarily, by the feedstock they utilise. Equipment for producing chemicals from solid feedstock, primarily coal and biomass, tends to be more capital-intensive than equipment for producing the same product from natural gas. Using ammonia as an example, for a unit of production, equipment costs using coal are more than twice as high as natural gas, whereas biomass equipment costs are nearly sevenfold higher. Process yields refer to the amount of product that can be obtained per unit of feedstock consumed, and are one of the most important determinants of the choice of route because they directly affect both feedstock and process energy consumption.

"d are one of the most important determinants of the choice of route because they directly affect both feedstock and process energy consumption. For the simultaneous production of HVCs from the same process run (“co-production” or “multi-product processes”), ethane as a feedstock offers the highest yields, using only 1.2 tonnes of feedstock per tonne (t/t) of HVCs produced. The introduction of catalysts in steam cracking can deliver yield gains of about 20% when using naphtha as feedstock.

To produce both ammonia and methanol, natural gas offers the highest yields. Bioenergy-based routes are typically more feedstock-intensive compared to their fossil-based counterparts due to their lower carbon and energy content. In co-production processes, there is typically a compromise between the overall amount of HVCs Page | 32 produced (process yield) and the diversity of products (ethylene, propylene and benzene, toluene and mixed xylenes (BTX) aromatics) obtained.

"based one, the mix of HVCs produced is predominantly composed of ethylene. In contrast, naphtha steam cracking delivers a more balanced portfolio of ethylene, propylene and BTX aromatics, but at a lower yield rate than the ethane-based route. The differences are mainly due to the degree of similarity between the chemical structure of the feedstock and the final product. The relative level of demand for the different HVCs can, therefore, be an important factor in feedstock selection. Single-product processes can be used to fill the gaps left by the use of relatively cheap, locally available feedstock.

Furthermore, despite the global market for oil, many of the lighter products – ethane and LPG, in particular – are either unavailable in some regions or are imported at significant additional cost. Natural gas tends to be more expensive than coal and oil products more costly than natural gas. Feedstock costs can represent anywhere between 15% and 85% of the levelised production costs of HVCs, depending on the feedstock choice. The prices of feedstocks and process energy inputs vary over time, according to the market dynamics of supply and demand. The surge in supply of ethane in the United States as the shale gas revolution picked up momentum led to a fall in ethane prices after 2011, to the extent that “ethane rejection” (ethane being left un- extracted from natural gas streams) became commonplace. For the production of HVCs, ethane crackers offer the consistently cheapest route from a simplified levelised cost perspective; but these units yield few products aside from ethylene, whereas naphtha and MTO units provide a more balanced slate of propylene, ethylene and aromatics.

Key message • Among the main costs of production, feedstock is the most influential factor in determining regional production advantages. These cost dynamics determine, to some extent, where primary chemical production takes place around the world. Regions with an advantageous feedstock position (e.g. Middle East and United States for HVCs) tend to contribute large volumes to the global production of primary chemicals. Asia Pacific accounts for half of global primary chemical production (326 Mt per year), with China as by far the largest chemicals producer in Asia, accounting for 20%, 33% and 55% of HVCs, ammonia and methanol global capacity, respectively. Because of the very limited availability of feedstock from natural gas liquids in China – the country’s natural gas output not being rich in these substances -- China depends heavily on naphtha feedstock (more than 90%) for HVCs.

Despite this, China has significantly ramped up LPG imports to feed PDH plants dedicated to propylene production in recent years. China’s feedstock deficit from indigenous petroleum sources has incentivised coal-to-olefin project developments, which has increasingly brought coal companies into petrochemical operations. Interestingly, the Saudi petrochemical holding, SABIC, has announced a joint venture plan with Shenhua, the largest coal producer in China, in the coal-to-chemicals field. The abundance and low price of coal in China means that, despite higher equipment costs and lower selectivity compared to natural gas, it is also advantageous in terms of production cost to obtain ammonia and methanol from coal.

Of the region’s total crude oil production (about 28 mb/d), only about 7 mb/d is refined locally, with the rest exported to global markets. Over 90% of naphtha output is also exported rather than being used locally as feedstock, partly as a result of the ample availability of far cheaper alternatives, such as ethane and LPG, which together make up more than half of regional HVC feedstock.

It hosts 16% of the world’s HVC production capacity, 7% of ammonia and 5% of methanol. The United States is rapidly expanding its petrochemical capacity, thanks to the shale revolution, which has led to natural gas liquids (NGLs) production doubling to nearly 4 mb/d in five years.

Where the equipment and capital are accessible, producers tend to add value by moving down the derivative chain. Trade data in the two largest-volume primary chemicals and their largest- volume derivatives show a relatively similar pattern over the last ten years. Global ammonia production in 2016 was 180 Mt, of which the globally traded volume was roughly 10-15 Mt, or about 7%. Over the previous decade trade volumes declined slightly, both in absolute terms and as a share of production, which stood at about 10% in 2006 but, overall, have remained relatively flat. The pattern of trade has also remained relatively consistent, with three of the top five exporters, and four of the top five importers, maintaining similar positions. Urea is the largest-volume derivative of ammonia, consuming more than half of the annual production of ammonia. It is more expensive than ammonia because it offers greater nutrient value (nitrogen) per tonne as a fertiliser, creating an additional margin for urea producers.

In volume terms, oil demand for chemical feedstock is dominated globally by the fractionation products of NGLs. Refineries do not produce ethane to any meaningful extent, and their LPG yields are typically below 5%. Thus, ethane, which accounts for almost a third of all chemical Page | 37 feedstock, and most of the LPG used as chemical feedstock, are supplied by NGL fractionation plants.

Key message • Refineries are only a secondary source of feedstock to the petrochemical sector, with most feedstock coming from NGL fractionation. The proportion of chemical feedstocks sourced from refineries is limited, not only because an average barrel of crude oil contains only a limited amount of light fractions (LPG), but also because of competition for straight-run yields of light distillates (naphtha) for gasoline blendstocks, to supplement that part coming from the upgrading of residual oils. Moreover, LPG and naphtha usually have negative margins (i.e. priced lower than crude oil), discouraging refineries from increasing their yields.

"s of a process that is geared to producing the transport fuels, gasoline, and middle distillates (diesel and kerosene) that dominate the refinery output product slate. It is their processing margins that determine the economic case for refineries to operate. However, global averages mask significant regional variations. Refinery yields of both LPG and naphtha are higher in regions where local supplies of NGLs are relatively low. In Asia, for example, NGL output is only 1 mb/d, just 6% of the global total, while total demand for ethane, LPG and naphtha is more than 8 mb/d. This means that Asian petrochemical manufacture is more reliant on naphtha, which can be supplied by refineries in higher volumes than LPG or ethane. This is one reason why Asia accounts for about 60% of global naphtha consumption as petrochemical feedstock. But, despite higher naphtha yields, the region is still a large net importer of naphtha and LPG from the Middle East and Europe.The Future of Petrochemicals © OECD/IEA 2018 Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers Asian operators have also started importing LPG and ethane for feedstock use in PDH plants and steam crackers, respectively.

Such seaborne ethane shipments are a very recent phenomenon, initially going from the United States to European and Indian steam crackers. The intention to import US ethane has also been announced by several Chinese companies. Even so, the use of naphtha in Asian petrochemical feedstock is not expected to Page | 38 decline significantly, because of the sheer scale of feedstock demand growth.

Key message • Production of petrochemical feedstock alone is not profitable for refineries. For refineries with integrated petrochemical operations, the commercial and economic conditions are different. One obvious benefit is the reduction in the transport costs for feedstock. As a result, steam crackers are often located in the same industrial hub as refinery sites, even when the ownership differs. Combining these assets within a single entity’s portfolio saves corporate overheads and staff costs, as well as providing potential synergies in utility supply and logistics infrastructure. The most important benefit comes from matching the complementarities in energy supply and demand requirements. 8 Upstream describes the refining and exploration industries from a chemical sector vantage point. lbb/DSU© OECD/IEA 2018 The Future of Petrochemicals Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers Not only is low-value refinery output, such as naphtha, a valuable feedstock for petrochemical processes (e.g. steam cracking), but a by-product of steam cracking, hydrogen, is a vital input into a refinery’s desulphuri",chunk_108
"sustainable plastics and fertilisers Not only is low-value refinery output, such as naphtha, a valuable feedstock for petrochemical processes (e.g. steam cracking), but a by-product of steam cracking, hydrogen, is a vital input into a refinery’s desulphurisation units: the higher the sulphur content in the crude oil being processed, the bigger the hydrogen requirement to meet increasingly stringent sulphur content limits in transport fuels. Refineries extract some hydrogen from naphtha reforming, but usually this is not sufficient. In these instances hydrogen is purchased to fill the gap. Other by-products Page | 39 of steam cracking, such as pyrolysis gasoline, can be further processed in refineries for use as gasoline components. In addition, integrated refinery-petrochemical processing may allow increased flexibility in the choice of crude oil feedstock, thus expanding the range of crude oil qualities that can be profitably processed in the refinery in different market conditions.

Key message • Regions with lighter feedstocks tend to source more of their propylene and BTX from refineries. Refineries also produce certain amounts of HVCs, such as propylene and BTX aromatics, directly from catalytic cracking and reforming processes. These can account for 1-2% of a refinery’s yield. More than 40% of propylene and around 80% of BTX aromatics are estimated to be sourced from refineries globally. Given the relationship between the feedstock used and product yields, where the share of heavier feedstock (e.g. naphtha) used in the petrochemical industry in a given region is large, the proportion of propylene and BTX aromatics produced in refineries tends to be lower. The demand for these HVCs does not usually dictate the operating regime of the refining processes in which they are co-produced, which are normally geared towards maximising gasoline and middle distillate outputs.

This may involve co-located or integrated facilities or investment in standalone NGL feedstock crackers. Different levels of operational integration can be achieved, up to a full integration aiming to maximise chemical yields across the operation. New direct crude-oil-to-chemicals technologies expand the opportunities for deep operational integration. The level and type of integration between refining and petrochemical operations varies by region. Europe and Asia both depend on crude oil feedstock imports and have limited local availability of NGLs. Under these circumstances, the case for operational integration is strong.

" production capacity of HVCs is owned by and takes place in the vicinity of refineries. Sinopec, a Chinese oil and gas company that is the world’s largest refiner, accounts for half on its own. Facilities tend to be located in the coastal provinces. A notable exception arises in the case of methanol-based routes to HVCs, which rely indirectly on coal as feedstock. The larger among these plants are located inland, close to coal reserves. One indicator of the general tendency for integration is the fact that the names of most Chinese refineries, whether independent or owned by state-owned oil companies, are more correctly translated into English using the word “petrochemical” rather than “refinery”. China also provides interesting examples of so-called “reverse integration”. In these instances, it is the petrochemical company that is moving upstream, rather than the refinery moving downstream. A major fabric company in China, Hengli Group, which is a supplier to global apparel brands, is not only building a petrochemical-oriented 400 kb/d refinery in Dalian, Liaoning province, but has been looking to purchase stakes in Abu Dhabi oil fields.

Currently the company is building a refinery in Brunei, geared towards producing petrochemical feedstock for export to China. The choice of an overseas location reflects, in part, the regulated crude oil import quota system in China. Brunei is close to the oil shipping routes through the straits of Malacca.A corrigendum has been issued for this page.

Key message • China’s petrochemical capacity follows refinery placement, with naphtha crackers concentrated in the 11 coastal provinces, while methanol-based output tends to be located in coal- producing regions.

"hemical/refinery integration is low compared to other regions. This may change. In recent years, the largest Middle Eastern oil companies have announced ambitious expansion programmes. The United Arab Emirates’ Abu Dhabi National Oil Corporation (ADNOC) announced a USD-45-billion downstream investment plan aiming to create the world’s largest refining and petrochemical facility by 2025. The company is also exploring downstream opportunities in India and other growing Asian markets. Such programmes are at least in part explained by the desire to create a more balanced revenue stream, including refining margins. Many of the refinery projects announced include integrated petrochemical units and the continued abundance of ethane and LPG supplies may result in expansion of more direct upstream integrated projects, bypassing refineries. The direct crude oil-to-chemicals route may soon come to challenge the current model of upstream integration. Saudi Aramco and SABIC have announced a large crude-oil-to-chemicals project of 400 thousand barrels per day capacity, five times the size of the only similar facility operating now, ExxonMobil’s plant in Singapore.

The Saudi project is expected to come on stream in the mid-2020s. Saudi Aramco is also developing a proprietary technology, based on thermal cracking of crude oil to produce chemicals, which promises a 70-80% yield of chemicals. A commercial design is expected to emerge by 2019. Whether such technology will spread to other regions is uncertain. In oil-importing regions, the margins from direct crude-oil- to-chemicals processes will be lower, due to inherently higher energy requirements (relative toThe Future of Petrochemicals © OECD/IEA 2018 Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers standard technologies) and transport costs for the feedstock. Concurrently, Saudi Aramco is also pursuing other avenues for growth in its petrochemical operations. The company has announced plans to purchase a controlling stake in SABIC, one of the largest petrochemical companies in the world.

Despite this, the combined share of gasoline and naphtha in total oil demand in Europe is just above one fifth, while middle distillates account for more than half. Gasoline demand has decreased by a third in Europe in the last decade, due to the switch of the passenger vehicle fleet to diesel. There is an excess of naphtha in Europe, which is exported as gasoline blendstock. Historically, the largest market for it has been in the northeast of the United States, but with higher refinery throughput in the United States, the region is being increasingly supplied by US refiners. Given the expected developments in supply-demand balances for oil products, the gasoline export market opportunities open to European refiners will diminish. Directing naphtha to petrochemical operations would seem an obvious solution; however, there are complex factors at play. About 40% of European naphtha steam cracking capacity is located within integrated refinery- petrochemical complexes, with non-integrated petrochemical companies accounting for the rest.

" steam cracking capacity is located within integrated refinery- petrochemical complexes, with non-integrated petrochemical companies accounting for the rest. Increasing integrated share even further would require new investment, either in green- field projects or in the acquisition of assets, similar to the recently announced Saudi Aramco- SABIC deal. Somewhat counter-intuitively, the opposite trend has been observed in Europe. First, a major petrochemical enterprise, Ineos, was formed on the basis of the petrochemical assets that BP divested in the early 1990s. Later, Ineos purchased two BP refineries, (in the United Kingdom and France), moving up the value chain. A similar transaction by LyondellBasell, however, was not successful, as the former Shell refinery in France purchased in 2008 was closed in 2011, although the petrochemical units have remained in operation. Ineos considered closing down refining operations at the Grangemouth site in the United Kingdom in 2013 when margins dropped, but met strong opposition from the local employees and the refining operations were maintained.

Its two refineries and associated petrochemical plants are now operated in a joint venture with PetroChina, which is the international arm of the China National Petroleum Corporation. Naphtha steam crackers integrated within refineries in the United States account for less than 20% of total US naphtha cracking capacity. Naphtha is not well placed to compete with much cheaper ethane. Naphtha molecules have been traditionally redirected to the gasoline pool, which makes up about half of US oil product demand. US oil companies have expanded petrochemical operations. Half of US ethane steam crackers are now owned by oil companies and several new projects are in the pipeline. Despite this, there is still greater separation of ownership of refining and petrochemical operations in the United States, relative to other regions.

Key message • The bulk of the petrochemical capacity in the United States is located on the Gulf Coast, coinciding with substantial refining capacity. This is because the region is a hotspot for both natural gas (NGLs for petrochemicals) and crude oil (for refineries) processing. In short, the regional idiosyncrasies of oil production and demand are an important factor in determining the extent of integration of refining and petrochemical operations. This is especially true for countries that depend on imported feedstocks. In feedstock-surplus regions, gasoline demand can influence the attractiveness of naphtha, both positively and negatively. Conversely, the availability of inexpensive feedstocks from NGL fractionation has a significant impact on the feedstock choice.

"ncrease, both through operational refining/petrochemical integration and via the more direct avenue of upstream/ petrochemical integration. A new wave of alternative feedstocks? A variety of carbon- and hydrogen-containing materials can replace oil, natural gas and coal as chemical feedstocks. Key among these are bioenergy products, which are a source of both carbon and hydrogen. Alternatively, each element can be sourced separately, for instance from gases arising from the iron and steel industry (e.g. coke oven gas (COG)) or from CO and 2 water. The main advantage of alternative feedstocks is that they can offer a net reduction in CO emissions – process emissions during production and end-of-life emissions – relative to 2 traditional feedstocks. The reductions stem from the fact that these substances would have otherwise gone unutilised (even if originally sourced from fossil fuels), or because they are renewable and therefore do not contribute to accumulation of CO in the atmosphere (on a 2 long-term basis).The Future of Petrochemicals © OECD/IEA 2018 Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers Ethylene – the most important HVC – is produced on an industrial scale from bioethanol derived from sugarcane and other bioenergy crops.

"e Future of Petrochemicals © OECD/IEA 2018 Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers Ethylene – the most important HVC – is produced on an industrial scale from bioethanol derived from sugarcane and other bioenergy crops. So-called bioethylene is produced by dehydrating (removing water) from the ethanol in a well-established process reaction. This route tends to be competitive only in areas in which bioethanol can be produced at a competitive cost, based on good local availability of bio-based raw materials. Brazil, which derives large quantities of ethanol from the fermentation of abundant sugarcane, hosts 50% of Page | 44 the world’s bioethylene capacity.

"lysis, as an alternative to using fossil fuel feedstocks. Electrolysis is already widely deployed in industry to produce metals, such as aluminium and lithium. Electrolysis-derived hydrogen can be used in the chemical industry as a building block for all primary chemicals. Combined with nitrogen, carbon and oxygen, hydrogen is used directly to produce methanol and ammonia, and indirectly (via methanol-to-olefins/aromatics) to produce the starting materials for the entire range of plastics and other chemical products. Electrolysers – the key piece of equipment required for electrolysis – operate by passing an electrical current between an anode and a cathode via an electrolyte. Catalysts are used to reduce the amount of electricity required. The largest electrolysers ever constructed operated in Norway between 1927 and 1991, fuelled by low-cost and abundant hydropower (Szymanski, 2017). The plants consumed 135 megawatts (MW) of electricity from adjacent hydropower facilities, and each produced 30 000 cubic metres of hydrogen per hour of operation.

Plans have been announced to build a solar-powered ammonia demonstration plant, to be commissioned in 2019 in Australia by Yara, the world’s largest ammonia producer (Brown, 2017). Efforts continue in Iowa in the United States to produce solar-ammonia for use both as a fertiliser and as a fuel (Schmuecker Pinehurst Farm LLC, 2017). The iron and steel sector generates several gases containing valuable components that make them suitable for use as fuels, reducing agents or even feedstock. About 20% of the methanol produced in China today uses COG as feedstock, employing the same technology as coal-based methanol production (without the gasification step). COG contains mainly hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide and CO , and it is generated as a by-product in coke oven plants. 2 There are various initiatives to explore the use of the gases arising from iron and steel works as chemical feedstock, even where the hydrogen to carbon balance is not as advantageous as in COG.

The Carbon2Chem project in Europe aims to demonstrate ways to convert such gases into ammonia and methanol, with production rates fluctuating to support electricity grid balancing needs (Thyssenkrupp, 2017). Processes that biologically convert these gases to ethanol have already been tested in an industrial context in China by LanzaTech and there are further plans to demonstrate this technology at commercial scale in Europe and China (LanzaTech, 2017). Although such gases often have a fossil fuel origin – primarily coal – their use as chemical feedstock can have a positive environmental impact, relative to the use of additional fossil fuel feedstock in their place.© OECD/IEA 2018 The Future of Petrochemicals Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers Figure 2.15 • Venture capital investment in alternative feedstocks Annual investment by conversion technology Share of cumulative investment by product family 120 Bulk chemicals 100 80 Intermediates Page | 45 60 Consumer products 40 Oils and solvents 20 Plastics 0 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 CO2 (chemical catalysis) Biomass (biocatalysi",chunk_127

The use of alternative feedstock is at an embryonic stage of development further downstream in the chemical sector. In the absence of mature industrial processes, it is instructive to look at the investments being made in technology start-ups as an indication of where investors see potential for growth in such technologies. During the five years preceding 2012, when investment in the clean technology sector was buoyant, more than USD 80 million per year was invested in alternative chemical feedstock start- ups, reflecting a trend of rising investment in the biotechnology sector in general. Since the end of the first clean technology surge in 2011, alternative chemical feedstock start-ups, using biocatalytic technologies, have struggled to attract the same levels of funding. One reason for this is the difficulty experienced in scaling up enzymatic conversion technologies from the laboratory to the market in the short time periods that are acceptable to venture capital investors (usually under five years).

Other biomass conversion technologies, including chemical catalysis, have received attention in recent years, as have technologies promising to convert CO to chemicals. However, since 2015 2 the value of the deals reported in this sector has fallen significantly, to just USD 10-20 million per year. Despite the promise of alternative feedstocks and the need to achieve sustainability in the chemical sector, the implications are either that investors do not think the near-term market opportunity is significant (or that the market value will be sustained in the long-term), or that there is a lack of new technologies being spun out of laboratories into start-ups.

This likely reflects that there is significant and growing consumer awareness of the environmental impacts of petroleum-based plastics. The ability to develop a complete plastic product that can be sold to consumer products firms without needing extensive further chemical processing or integration with other value chains is another factor. Furthermore, plastics are a large and rapidly growing Page | 46 market worldwide that is highly differentiated by performance.

The specific process energy demand per unit of product output (specific energy consumption (SEC)) depends not only on the feedstock used but also on local factors, such as the amount of thermal integration at the site, the age of the plant, and the operating and maintenance practices. The greatest gains in terms of SEC reductions result from a change in feedstock, from solid to gas or liquid feeds. For coal-based ammonia or methanol, even the best-performing SEC is around twice as high as the SEC related to production from natural gas. By contrast, feedstock changes within the gas or liquid range yield only incremental gains in process energy performance – the differential between the best performing SEC for naphtha and for ethane steam cracking is less than 5%, with the latter typically requiring the greater amount of process energy.

Local characteristics matter for process energy demand. Heat can be transferred from one gas or fluid to another within a process. This enables, for example, the preheating by hot exhaust gases of tepid input gases, resulting in fuel savings. The net level of steam required in a process can be negative, meaning that the process produces steam in excess of its own demand, as is often the case with steam crackers.

In other CVH t/JG© OECD/IEA 2018 The Future of Petrochemicals Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers regions, consumption can be up to 50% above the optimum. Whether this results in an overall cost disadvantage depends on fuel prices. Generally the contribution of electricity to SEC in primary chemical production is relatively small, and it tends not to vary as much between plants as the thermal components. This is because electrical equipment for chemical processes, such as motors, pumps and fans, tends to be relatively uniform and close to maximum efficiency, if sized and maintained correctly.

Chemicals and the environment The environmental impact associated with chemical products is as multi-faceted as their role in society. Among other environmental ills, the production of chemicals leads to carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions, air pollutants and water demand. But chemical products can also facilitate 2 environmental progress in other sectors. Any boundary drawn around the environmental impact Page | 49 of a product or industrial sector is imperfect. The key environmental constraint considered in this work is direct CO emissions from the chemical and petrochemical sector. This, along with 2 investments and fuel costs, are the key drivers of the technology selections and other results presented in later chapters.

"d in the figure do not provide an exhaustive account of the environmental burdens associated with the chemical sector and its products, nor does the figure provide an account of the environmental benefits facilitated by chemical products, which are discussed later in this chapter. Key message • Beyond CO emissions, the chemical sector places a multi-faceted burden on the 2 environment: air pollutants, water demand and water pollutants are key elements to consider. As noted earlier, chemical production, despite being the largest industrial energy consumer, is only the third largest source of industrial CO emissions, followed by the iron and steel, and 2 cement sectors, because more than half of its energy input is used as feedstock and leaves the sector locked into products. Further CO emissions and air pollutants are released during the use 2 of certain chemical products, such as fertilisers and cleaning products. Without effective management of waste and agricultural practices, plastics and fertilisers can cause devastation to marine life when they leak into bodies of water. This chapter explores some key facets of these burdens, concentrating on CO emissions, air and water pollution, and water demand. 2 CO emissions from the chemical sector 2 Today, CO emissions",chunk_139
" devastation to marine life when they leak into bodies of water. This chapter explores some key facets of these burdens, concentrating on CO emissions, air and water pollution, and water demand. 2 CO emissions from the chemical sector 2 Today, CO emissions from the chemical sector are approximately 1.5 gigatonnes of carbon 2 dioxide (GtCO ) per year globally, or 18% of industrial CO emissions. The sector’s emissions stem 2 2 from two key sources. First, energy-related emissions (1.3 GtCO or 85%) are released, as in any 2 other industrial sector, when fuel is combusted to generate heat, both directly and for the production of steam on-site. Second, process CO emissions (0.2 GtCO or 15%) reflect the 2 2 difference in carbon content between the feedstock and the product. For example, if roughly 0.4 tonnes of methane feedstock (75% carbon) is required to make a tonne of ammonia (0% carbon), the process CO emissions per tonne of ammonia product would be approximately 2The Future of Petrochemicals © OECD/IEA 2018 Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers 1.1 tonnes of carbon dioxide (tCO ).

"the total CO emissions in the chemical sector. 2 Ammonia is the single largest source, contributing 49% of the primary chemicals’ CO emissions, 2 followed by high-value chemicals (HVCs) (27%) and methanol (24%). The CO intensity of coal- 2 based ammonia and methanol is, respectively, more than two and half times and almost five times that based on natural gas-based routes. As might be expected, the regional shares of CO emissions relating to primary chemical 2 production follow regional shares of production, particularly ammonia. Asia Pacific accounts for a particularly large share of process emissions, due to the People’s Republic of China10 using coal as feedstock. The relative proportions of process and energy-related emissions in other regions are similar, with regions utilising lighter feedstocks (e.g. the Middle East) showing lower proportions of process emissions. As in other industrial sectors, CO generated by the sector has only three possible pathways: it 2 can be released to the atmosphere, utilised or stored.

" stored. The concept of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) encompasses a range of technologies and strategies for mitigating CO 2 emissions. Some of the “lowest hanging fruit” among CCUS applications are to be found in the chemical sector. This is because CO is separated from the process stream, in both ammonia and 2 methanol production facilities, in order to meet the chemical process requirements. The cost of CO captured from concentrated process emissions from ammonia production can be 2 as little as USD 25 (United States dollars)/tCO (Irlam, 2017). These cheaper opportunities for CO 2 2 capture from ammonia production are limited by the availability of concentrated emissions 9 Including hydrofluorocarbons, nitrous oxide, sulphur hexafluoride and methane.

All of this 1.7 MtCO /yr capture capacity is located in the United States, with the captured 2 CO used for enhanced oil recovery.

Key message • Regions with high levels of production, particularly of ammonia, generate correspondingly high levels of CO emissions. 2 The political climate surrounding CCUS varies among regions, particularly the “S” – storage – component. Encouraging signs can be seen in the United States’ recent moves to increase incentives for the storage and use of CO through the so-called “45Q” legislation, which contains a 2 provision to raise the tax credit for the permanent geological storage of a tonne of CO from USD 22 2 to USD 50 in 2026 (Bennett and Stanley, 2018).

It is estimated this could increase CO capture by 2 10-30 MtCO /yr over the next six years in the United States, with most of the CO used for 2 2 enhanced oil recovery. In some parts of Europe, the outlook is less encouraging. Germany has effectively banned large- scale storage of CO gas (German Government, 2012). The “Speicherung von Kohlendioxid” (CO 2 2 storage act) was signed into German law in 2012, restricting total annual storage to 4 MtCO . By 2 contrast, the Netherlands has ambitious plans, including funding to store 18 MtCO from industrial 2 sources annually by 2030 (Dutch Government Parties Coalition, 2017). This is equivalent to one- third of the Netherlands’ targeted industrial CO emissions savings. 2 The use of CO for specialised purposes, such as the production of urea and carbonated beverages 2 is widespread, but these particular avenues lead to limited – if any – permanent reductions in CO 2 over the full life cycle.

"ction of urea and carbonated beverages 2 is widespread, but these particular avenues lead to limited – if any – permanent reductions in CO 2 over the full life cycle. As soon as the carbonated beverage is opened or the urea-based fertiliser is applied to the soil, release of the CO to the atmosphere begins again. Additional potential 2 pathways exist for the utilisation of CO as a feedstock elsewhere in the chemical sector, such as 2 forming the carbon content of plastics. Producing a tonne of urea requires a minimum of 0.73 tCO . In rare cases, CO is manufactured or 2 2 sourced from naturally occurring underground deposits, but in the majority of cases it is provided by an adjacent ammonia plant. Nearly half of all process CO generated during ammonia production 2 globally (almost 130 MtCO /yr) is used in this way as a raw material input for urea production, with 2 a further 140 MtCO being released. Most CO generated during ammonia production is 2 2 combustion related, totalling nearly 300 MtCO . It is not so easy to capture the more dilute – and 2 therefore more expensive to separate – CO streams generated in combustion processes. 2 )ry/OCtM( snoissime OC 2 2The Future of Petrochemicals © OECD/IEA 2018 Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers Figure 3.4 ",chunk_146

" for urea production annually, but the bulk of this is released 2 downstream in the agriculture sector, sometimes only days later. CO utilisation for urea production is, by a considerable margin, the largest carbon capture and 2 utilisation application globally. But it is really only a rest stop on the road to emissions release. After the urea leaves the production plant, it is sold, stored, and then applied to the soil in order to fulfil its primary purpose – delivering the nitrogen it contains (46% by weight) to the roots of plants and crops. The CO that was embedded in the urea is then released to the soil and, as the 2 urea decomposes, to the atmosphere. Air pollutants from primary chemical production Air pollution is a public health crisis and the fourth-largest overall risk factor for human health worldwide, after high blood pressure, dietary risks, and smoking (IEA, 2016a).
