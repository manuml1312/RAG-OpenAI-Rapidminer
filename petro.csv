The IEA examines the full spectrum of energy issues including oil, gas and coal supply 
and demand, renewable energy technologies, electricity markets, energy efficiency, access 
to energy, demand side management and much more. Through its work, the IEA advocates 
policies that will enhance the reliability, affordability and sustainability of energy in its  
30 member countries, 7 association countries and beyond.
The four main areas of IEA focus are: 
n   Energy Security : Promoting diversity, efficiency, flexibility and reliability for all fuels 
and energy sources;
n  Economic Development : Supporting free markets to foster economic growth and 
eliminate energy poverty;
n	 Environmental Awareness : Analysing policy options to offset the impact 
of energy production and use on the environment, especially for 
tackling climate change and air pollution; and
n  Engagement Worldwide : Working closely with association 
and partner countries, especially major emerging 
economies, to find solutions to shared 
energy and environmental 
concerns.

Page | 3 Foreword  
We live in  a world dependent on petrochemicals.  From the cars we drive to the food on our 
plates, the product s and materials we derive from petrochemicals are fundamental to  many 
aspects of modern society. Plastics and fertilisers, the two largest groups of chemical sector 
products , are indispensable in our everyday lives. P lastic s is the fastest -growing group of bulk 
materials in the world , and synthetic nitrogen fertilisers  underpin nearly half the world’s food 
production.   
The manufacture of petrochemicals and their derivatives absorbs an  increasing proportion of the 
world’s oil and gas – approximately 1 4% (13  million barrels per day [mb/d] ) for oil and 8% 
(300  billion  cubi c metr es [bcm] ) for gas . Because much of this energy enters the petrochemicals 
sector as feedstock and does not undergo combustion, the sector achieves the seemingly 
contradictory feat of being both the largest industrial energy consumer and yet only the 
third -largest industrial carbon dioxide (CO 2) emitter.  Even so, with the market for petrochemical 
product s set to expand further as the global economy develops,  the future of the petrochemicals 
industry is of major  significance for both  global energy security and the environment.  
This I nternational Energy Agency  (IEA) analysis  explains the circumstances of the petrochemicals 
industry today and projects how it might develop to 2050.  Using the IEA Reference Technology 
Scenario , the projections are first made based on  established trends . Then,  a path to a 
sustainable future is drawn  for the industry,  one consistent  with the UN Susta inable 
Development Goals – the Clean Technology Scenario .  
The trajectory of the chemical sector in the Reference Technology Scenar io implies a rate of 
growth in oil demand that is higher  than that of any other sector. Of the nearly 10  mb/d growth 
in total oil demand projected for 2030, the chemical sector is on course to account for more than 
a third . The sector also plays a signific ant role in the total growth in gas demand, where it 
account s for 7% of the roughly 850  bcm global increase by 2030.  
Because  of this robust growth in fossil fuel consumption, direct CO 2 emissions from the sector 
increase by around 20% by 2030 and 30% by 2050. Similar deleterious rises occur in air pollutants 
and water demand. Perhaps most alarmingly, without drastic improvements in the management 
of waste stemming from the sector’s key m aterial output  – plastics  – the quantity of plastic 
waste , including that entering the oceans , continues to rise from today’s already unacceptable 
levels.  
An alternative future for petrochemicals  – one in which plastics and fertilisers, in particular, are  
produced more sustainably  – is entirely feasible. In t his path way, traced in the Clean Technology 
Scenario,  the petrochemical industry makes the necessary contribution s to realis ing the UN g oals. 
Our analysis concludes by identifying two priority areas fo r those  committed to carrying out this 
vital transition, along with specific actions to be taken in each.  
This is the third book in an IEA series concentrating on what I refer to as “blind spots” in global 
energy: major areas of energy demand that  deserve a greater level of attention from 
policy  makers. Previous studies in the series have focused on energy use in air -conditioning and 
trucks. There will be more.

Page | 11 Executi ve summary  
Petrochemical products are everywhere …  
Petrochemicals, which turn oil and gas into all sorts of daily products –  such as plastics, 
fertilisers, packaging, clothing, digital devices , medical equipment, detergents or tyres – are 
integral to modern societies. In addition to products critical to our daily lives,  petrochemicals are 
also found in many parts of the modern energy system, including solar panels, wind turbine 
blades, batteries, thermal insulation for buildings , and electric vehicle parts.  
Already a major component of the global energy system, the importance of petrochemicals is 
growing even more . Demand for plastics –  the most familiar of petrochemical products –  has 
outpaced all other b ulk materials (such as steel, aluminium or cement), nearly doubling since the 
start of the millennium . The United States, Europe, and other advanced economies currently use 
up to 20 times as much plastic and up to 10 times as much fertiliser as India, Indo nesia , and other 
developing economies on a per capita basis, underscoring the huge potential for growth 
worldwide.  
Feedstocks fly under the radar.  Chemicals produced from oil and gas make up around 90% of all 
raw materials , which are known as feedstocks ; the rest com es from coal and biomass. About half 
of the petrochemical sector’s energy consumption consists of fuels used as raw materials to 
provid e the molecules to physically construct products.  
… and have become the fastest -growing source of oil consumption  
The growing role of p etrochemicals  is one of the key “blind spots ” in the global energy debate . 
The diversity and complexity of this sector means that petrochemicals receive less attention than 
other sectors, despite their rising importance.  
Petrochemicals are rapidly becoming the largest driver of global oil consumption . They are set 
to account for more than a third  of the growth in oil demand to 2030, and nearly half to 2050 ,1 
ahead of trucks, aviation and shipping. At the same time, currentl y dominant sources of oil 
demand, especially passenger vehicles, diminish in importance thanks to a combination of better 
fuel economy, rising public transport, alternative fuels , and electrification . Petrochemicals are  
also poised to consume an additional  56 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas by 2030, 
equivalent to about half of Canada’s total gas consumption  today . 
Countries , including  the People’s Republic of China2 and the United States, will see the largest 
near -term capacity additions; longer -term growth is led by Asia and the Middle East. The 
United  States is expected to increase its global market share for ethylene (steam cracking) to 22% 
by 2025, up from 20% in  2017. Along with the Middle East, the United  States has a feedstock 
advantage in its access to low -cost ethane owing  to its abundant natural gas supplies . This 
advantage allow s both regions to gain the lion’s share of ethane -based chemical exports in the 
short and medium term. Coal -based methanol -to-olefins capacity in China nearly doubles 
between 2017 and 2025, providing the material inputs for its large domestic manufacturing base. 
In the longer run, Asia and the Middle East both increase their market sh are of high -value 
chemical production by 10  percentage points , while the share coming from Europe and the 
United  States decreases. By 2050, India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East together account for 
about 30% of global ammonia production.

Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers  
 Page | 12 The combinati on of a growing global economy, rising population,  and technological 
development will translate into  an increasing demand for petrochemical products.  Although 
substantial increases in recycling and efforts to curb single -use plastics  take place, especially  led 
by Europe, Japan and Korea , these efforts will be far outweighed by the sharp increase in 
developing economies of plastic consumption (as well as its disposal). The difficult y in finding 
alternatives is another factor underpinning the robust overall demand growth  for petrochemical 
products.  
An evolving landscape for both petrochemical and oil and  gas industries  
Increasing global competition in the industry is driven by new supply dynamics for chemical 
feedstocks. After two decades of stagnation and de cline, the United States has returned to 
prominence as a low -cost region for chemical production thanks to the shale gas revolution . 
Today, the United States is home to around  40% of the global capacity to produce ethane- based 
petrochemical s. Led by Saudi Arabia and Iran, the  Middle East remains the low -cost champion for 
key petrochemicals , with a host of new project s announced across the region.  China and Europe 
each account for around a quarter of the global capacity for naphtha -based , high -value 
chemicals, but they have only very small shares of capacity based on lighter feedstocks because  
of limited availability. China’s burgeoning coal- based chemical industry, once a speculative 
proposition, now embodies steady technological improvements. India is poise d to grow  strongly 
from its current level of only 4% of global capacity  to satisfy increasing domestic demand . 
Oil companies are increasingly pursuing integration along the petrochemical value chain . 
Against a backdrop of slow er gasoline demand growth , robust growth prospects for chemical 
products , and attractive margins, oil companies are further strengthening their links with 
petrochemical markets . New , direct crude -oil-to-chemicals process routes may also come into 
play, offering alternatives to traditional refining/petrochemical operations although the 
technology remains challenging for now. For example, Saudi Aramco and SABIC have recently 
announced a large crude -to-chemicals project of 0.4  mb/d, five times the size of the only existing 
facility in S ingapore.  
The production, use and disposal of chemicals take an environmental toll …  
Petrochemicals face  a number of climate, air quality , and water pollution challenges.  
Petrochemical products provide substantial benefits to society,  including a growing number of 
applications in various cutting -edge, clean technologies critical to a sustainable energy system . 
However, t he production, use , and disposal of these  products pose a variety of sustainability 
challenges that need to be addres sed. 
Even though the chemical sector consumes  roughly as much energy as the steel and cement 
sectors combined,  it emits less CO 2 than either sector. Still, this amounts to around 1.5 GtCO 2, 
which is  18% of all industrial- sector CO 2 emissions , or 5% of total combustion -related CO 2 
emissions.  This is in part because the chemical industry consumes more oil and gas than other 
heavy industries, which tend to rely more on coal. Another contributing factor is that the carbon 
contained in chemical feedstock s is mostly locked into final products (such as plastics), and it is 
released only when the products are burned or decompose.  
… but solutions are achievable and cost -effective  
In our Clean Technology Scenario  (CTS), which provides an ambitious but achievable pathway 
for the chemical sector, environmental impacts decline across  the board. In the CTS,  air 
pollutants from primary chemical production decline by almost  90% by 2050 ; and water demand 
is nearly  30% lower than in the base scenario. The CTS also emphasises waste management © OECD/IEA 201 8 The Future of Petrochemicals

cumulative , ocean -bound , plastic waste by 2050 , compared to the base scenario –  a major step 
to curb the 10  million  tonnes of plastic waste th at leak into the world’s oceans every year, an 
environmental problem that is garnering much attention across the globe.  
By 2050, cumulative CO 2 emission savings from increased plastic recycling and reuse are 
equivalent to about half the annual emissions from the chemical sector today.  In the CTS, the 
global average collection rate of plastic waste increases nearly  three- fold by 2050. This results  in 
increased production of recycled plastics and a cumulative saving of around 5% in high -value 
chemical demand, compared to current trends. This outcome  poses a significant technical 
challenge, requiring  mature economies to raise average collection rates  to the maximum 
practical level and emerging economies to match the best rates achieved today.   
The sector’s  clean transition is led by c arbon capture, utilisation and s torage (CCUS), catalytic 
processes,  and a shift from coal to natural gas. Some of the most cost -effective opportunities for 
CCUS can be found in the chemical sector, which explains its leading role among scalable options 
for reducing emissions. Catalytic alternatives to traditional process routes can provide more than 
15% of energy savings per unit of production. Shifts from coal to natural gas for both ammonia 
and methanol production, mainly in China, result in decreases in both process emissions and 
energy intensity. Despite falling investment costs, processes based on electricity and biom ass 
struggle to compete on cost in most regions, due to high prices in a world where these 
low-carbon energy carriers are in high demand.  
The surge in the share of lighter oil products required for petrochemical feedstocks may pose 
challenges for refining in the CTS. Oil demand related to plastic consumption overtakes that for 
road passenger transport by 2050. This has important implications for refiners whose processes 
are currently set up to produce both heavy and light products. T he increase in light tig ht oil (LTO) 
production in the United States is expected to help address the challenge  because  LTO is an 
easier starting point for producing lighter oil products. However, the long -term sustainability of 
this contribution will also depend on how the resour ce base , technology , and market conditions 
of LTO evolve.   The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8

Part A : Petrochemicals today  
Petrochemicals surround us, yet they constitute  one of the key “blind spots”  of the energy 
system. Even among energy professionals , the chemical and petrochemical sector3 is 
inadequately  understood, which often lead s to underestimating it  in energy terms . With the 
sector a ccounting for 14% (1 3 million barrels per day ) and 8% (30 0 billion cubic metres ) of the 
total primary demand for oil and natural gas  respectively , this deficit of attention deserves 
redress.  
A unique aspect of petrochemical production  that helps to account for the  lack of attention  is the 
consum ption of energy as “ feedstock ”: about  half the sector’s  energy input is not combusted but 
is consumed as raw material.  Understanding the concept of using energy for feedstock is key t o 
understanding petrochemicals.  
Part A of this publication , which concentrates on the situation as it stands today,4 aims to correct  
the imbalance  while  exploring the role the sector plays in society  (Chapter 1) , the energy system 
(Chapter 2) , and the environment  (Chapter 3) . Future p rospects are examined in Part B.

Page | 15 Chapter 1. Chemicals and society  
Chemical products are ubiquitous in modern society. It is unusual  to find oneself in a building or 
vehicle unadorned with plastics, rubber or synthetic textiles, and these materials are intimately 
engrained in our daily routines: toothbrushes, carrier bags, food packaging, mobile phones, 
computers, carpets, clothes, fur niture… and these are just the items we see every day.  
Where they are not the main consti tuent, chemical products often enhance other bulk materi als, 
such as metal and timber, for example by offering  protective ( e.g. varnish) and decorative 
(e.g. paint) coatings. Combinations of plastics in electronic equipment are increasingly displacing 
paper as the medium for conveying information in a digitiz ed world. Modern agricultural systems 
would struggle to maintain the  current level of output without fertilisers and other 
agrochemicals. The pharmaceutical sector as we know it would not exist. It is no understatement 
to say we live in a world dependent on chemicals.

A world dependent on chemicals  
Underlying the demand for chemical products is the demand for the services they provide, such 
as sustenance, mobility and thermal comfort. These services encom pass both universal human 
needs and the desire  of the global population for improved  living standards. To take s ustenance

 Page | 16 as an  example, fertiliser  is used to increase the uptake by plants  of vital nutrients, thereby 
increasing agric ultural yields and crop reliability. Plastics are used throughout the global food 
system in transportation, preservation  and consumption. Plastic packaging, much of which is 
used for food  and, increasingly , beverages, is the largest component of single end -use plastic 
demand, accounting for approximately 36% globally.  
As people live longer and enjoy increasing standards of living, they are likely to consume more of 
the products mentioned above. Furthermore, facilitating a more sustainable future relies 
increasingly on  outputs from the chemical sector. For example, r educing the overall weight of 
vehicles , a strategy pursued to reduce fuel consumption, is supported through the integration of 
plastic -based materials. Modern insulation materials that reduce the demand for heating and 
cooling in buildings also have a strong chemical component.  
As with most dependencies, t here is an accompanying burden. Chemical products take an 
environmental toll, both when produced and after use, by ending up where they ought  not to. 
The chemical sector’s final energy consumption , which is the highest of any industrial sector, is 
mainly composed of fossil fuels. In consuming this energy, the sector releases carbon dioxide 
(CO 2) emissions and air pollutants and contributes to t he demand for water for energy.  
When deposited in waterways, plastics, fertilisers and other products cause damage to marine 
ecosystems, each in their own way. When fertilisers are applied to fields in excess quantities –  or 
just before a deluge –  they ca n leach, resulting in high nutrient concentrations in nearby rivers 
and estuaries. This can result in eutrophication, whereby a surge in algae growth deprives all 
other life of oxygen, leading to suffocation. With plastics, the pathway is more direct, but no less 
devastating to marine life. Plastics find their way into the oceans when they are inadequately 
disposed of, transported and processed. They can then be  broken down into particles and be 
ingested by fish.  
The rise of the chemical sector  
Society’s gr owing dependence on chemicals has been  reflected by a steady period of growth in 
the output of the chemical and petrochemical sector. The production of plastics –  one of the 
sector’s key material outputs –  has increased globally by more than tenfold since 1970, faster 
than the rate of growth of any other group of bulk materials and almost 60% faster than growth 
of gross domestic product ( GDP ). Ammonia –  a key primary chemical and the chemical base of all 
nitrogen fertilisers – has seen production increases more in line with those of other energy -
intensive sectors , which have each undergone between a three - and sevenfold increase during 
this period.  
Since the millennium, bulk materials such as cement, crude steel, and primary aluminium  have 
matched  and, in some cases , largely exceeded  GDP growth rates , particularly  to meet new 
infrastructure needs in rapidly developing economies such as in the People’s Republic of China  
(hereafter, “China”) . By  contrast, there are initial signs of a decoupling between ammonia  
production and GDP growth , partly because  of increasing efficiency  in the use of fertilisers. 
Overall, t his strong trajectory of activity growth reflects the  relatively late emergence of 
petrochemicals as an industrial sector  and the continuing advance of  its associated technology . 
Some key developments in the chemical sector pre- date the period for which activity data are 
available. For example, s ome important industrial chemicals can be traced back to the 18th  
century (notably sulphuric acid ); but many o f those most relevant to today’s consumers were not 
invented or produced at sufficient  scale for more than another century. Ammonia was first 
produced with a practical level of thermodynamic efficiency after the invention of the Haber -
Bosch process in 1909 , and n itrogen fertiliser,  production of which accounts for 80% of ammonia  
use today, is still synthesised via the Haber- Bosch process.  © OECD/IEA 201 8 The Future of Petrochemicals

Page | 17  Box 1.1 • Chemical s and  petrochemical s 
Modern petrochemistry ha s its origins in the oil and gas industry. Petrochemicals are a su bset of industrial 
chemicals, hence the full name of the industrial sector that produces them: the “ chemical and petrochemical 
sector” . In the context of this report, petrochemicals are defined as  chemicals derived from petroleum (oil) 
products, such as ethane and naphtha, or from natural gas. Using this definition, petrochemicals account for 
90% of total feedstock demand in chemical production today. Chemicals  such as light olefins (ethylene and 
propylene) and aromatics (benzene, toluene and mixe d xylenes [BTX]), typically called “ high- value chemicals ” 
(HVCs), are often co -produced in a process such as steam cracking. Demand for HVCs  tends to be driven by  the 
consumption of  plastics, synthetic fibres and rubber. Ammonia is an example of a chemical  that, though it can 
be produced fr om oil,  is more commonly produced today from natural gas or coal. Methanol, an important 
industrial alcohol, is similar to ammonia in this regard.  The production of “ primary chemicals ” (the collective 
term for HVCs , ammon ia, and methanol together ), account s for around -two-thirds  of total energy  demand in 
the chemical sector. They are the main focus of  this study.  
 Figure 1.2 • Key chemicals and chemical groups  
 
Notes:  Other chemicals  refers  to those not included within the core scope of this modelling. The partial overlap with the 
petrochemicals boundary indicates the capacity to produce each of these chemicals both from oil and  gas, and from other 
non-“petro”  sources.   
The petrochemicals l isted above can all be technically produced today from a variety of different products and 
substances, including forms of renewable energy such as biomass,  water and CO 2 or other carbon sources. 
This could potentially lead to the “petro”  prefix becoming redundant . However, the vast majori ty of industrial 
chemicals use oil, natural gas,  or coal both as their input materials and as the sour ces of energy for fuelling the  
production processes. Not only are these commodities cheap to procure a nd process  relative to the 
alternatives, but some atomic building blocks required for chemical products such as plastics and fertiliser s 
(primarily carbon and hydrogen ) are present in convenient quantities and arrangements.  
 
The first plastic is thought to have been Parkesine , invented by Alexander Parkes in 1856 ; but the 
explosion of plastics into mainstream applications did not take place until the second half of the 
20th  centu ry. A key pre cursor process to large -scale poly mer production – steam cracking – was 
invented in the early 1900s  and proved a  critical step on the way to achieving large -scale 
production of what were to be the most transformational set of materials since the invention of 
steel alloys.  
What drives chemic al consumption?  
It is challenging today to imagine a world without plastics and fertilisers. An example of multiple 
chemical products playing a fundamental role in society is  found  in the supply chains that 
underpin modern food production. Fertilisers and agrochemicals are used extensively to promote 
crop growth and provide  protection against harmful organisms and pathogens. Plastic packaging 
(the single largest source  of plastic demand) plays an instrumental role in delivering food from 
the pasture to the plate. This and a plethora of other applications result in widespread and 
persistent demand for these products across most major regions.

Key message •  Demand for p lastics has  grown faster than that for any other group of bulk materials, 
whereas  demand for ammonia has grown more steadily and even displays some decoupling from 
economic growth after 2000.  
Regional consumption patterns for se veral important plastics and fertiliser s show that as 
wealth  (measured in GDP per capita) increase s, so does the consumption of these products. 
However, i n regions with high income per capita, demand saturation appears to emerge for 
some products, especially fertilisers. In high -income countries such as Japan, the United  States , 
and parts of Western Europe, annual demand for key nitrogen fertilisers has stabilised at 
around  85-135 kilogram mes per cap ita (kg/capita) , with limited growth per capita having 
occurred over the last 15 -20 years. In lower -income and rapidly developing regions such as 
India, China and Africa, demand for these products is still on the increase (1 -2% annual  growth 
rates are not uncommon) , and current consump tion ranges from as low as 1 2 kg/cap ita to 
around 6 0 kg/capita.  
Plastic use show s fewer clear signs of saturation , and the range of consumption levels is even 
wider than that of fertilisers, although both the quality and quantity of data available on 
plastics consumption tend to be lower than for other bulk materials . Determining consumption 
patterns is further complicated by the trade in plastic goods that takes place after 
manufacturing. From the limited data available, it appears that developing regions currently 
consume as little  as 4 kg/cap ita of key plastic resins , but growth rates are high, sometimes 
entering double -digit levels . In higher -income  countries, consumption levels generally range  
from 55 -80 kg/cap ita, though most mature economies appe ar to be exhibiting some signs of 
saturation around the 6 0 kg/capita level.     200   400   600   800  1 000  1 200

Key message • High -income countries use up to 10 times as much fertiliser , and up to 2 0 times as much 
plastic , per capita as lower-income countries, indica ting significant global growth potential.  
Plastic has a broad set of applications , familiar to many consumers. From carrier bags to cars , 
plastic  is everywhere, making it one of the most versatile materials yet invented . It is, in fact, a 
group of materials varying  in composition. Different  types of plastics, or “ resins ”, are used for 
different purposes,  depending on the specification required in  the end -use application. Individual 
types of plastic are usually distinguished by using their Resin Identification  Code  (see Box 1.2) or 
by referring to the name of the dominant polymer  in their  composition.  
Poly mers are chains of individual molecules (called monomers ): ethylene is the monomer used to 
make polyethylene. Some polymers contain more than one monomer, such as acrylonitrile 
butadiene styrene, which is a polymer of the monomers acrylonitrile, butadiene and styrene.  
Plastics can also  be referred to by their trade  name : famous examples include Perspex, the trade 
name for a resin composed of polymethyl methacrylate, and Bakelite, the mercifully shorter 
name given to the resin of phe nol and formaldehyde: polyoxybenzyl methylene glycol anhydride . 
Packaging, the largest end -use segment  by some margin, accounts for 36 % of global plastic 
demand. This segment includes both consumer packaging, such as drinks bottles made of 
polyethylene ter ephthalate (PET), and the  packaging used for business -to-business transactions 
and in industry  at large . Synthetic textiles, which together constitute the second -largest end-use 
segment, are generally considered to be a distinct sub -sector  and, thus,  are d iscussed separately 
below. The construction industry is the second most important non -textile market , accounting 
for 16 % of global consu mption, a n important plastic for the construction industry being polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC), which is used for window and door frames, and underground pipes, due to its 
stiffness and durability.  
Consumer products, including toys and utensils, are the next- largest demand segment (10 %), 
with a fairly even utilisation of various resins. Polyethylene, both high -density (HDPE) an d low -
density (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) are used  evenly across the remaining 
end-use segments. P olyurethanes are a special case, being  reserved for specialty applications, 050100150

Key message • Packaging is t he leading end -use of plastic consumpti on globally. The most important 
types of plastic by volume  are polyethylene and polypropylene.  
Synthetic textile products are made from fibre that  is polymerised from many of the same resins 
used in  the other plastic end-use segments mentioned above ( with PET and PP being the most 
prevalent). Key synthetic fibre products include rope, carpet and clothing, alongside a multitude 
of specialist applications: Kevlar , a type of lightweight and bullet -proof body armour, is made 
from a synthetic thermoplastic fibre. Polyester fibre (or P ET fibre) , by far the largest -volume 
synthetic fibre, recently overtook cotton as the largest- volume fibre produced globally. Today, 
polyester eclipses demand for all other fibre combined , inclu ding natural fibres such as  wool and 
cotton , accounting for about 60% of total global fibre production (Mills, 2011) . 
 Box 1.2 • Key plastics and their typical applications  
There are two broad categories of  plastics : thermoplastics  and thermosets.  Thermoplastics  are those that 
constitute the familiar plastic obj ects around us in everyday life;  thermosets tend to be more specialist 
materials and resins. Whereas th ermosets cannot be effectively recycled ( except  by grinding them down and 
using them as filler material), most ther moplastics can. Resin Identification  Codes 01-07, used to distingui sh 
the main thermoplastics , are often printed on the bottom of plastic pac kaging and other goods in order to 
assist  their sorting prior to recycling.

02 – HDPE . HDPE  is one of the most versatile plastics, used in anything from shampoo bottles to hard hats. It is 
made entirely of ethylene and is among the most recycled plastics.  
03 – PVC. PVC is a tough resin that is most frequently used in construction. PVC windows, doors and pipes are 
commonplace on construction sites and in buildings throughout the world.  
04 – LDPE . LDPE  was the first polyethylene plastic to be invented and is another key plastic used for packaging . 
It is the key constituent of most plastic carrier bags.  
05 – PP. PP is a versatile plastic with many end -uses. Because i t has a higher melting point than some other 
key polymers, it  is often used in automotive applications, where high temperatures can be  encountered.  
06 – PS. PS  comes in three main forms:  “general purpose”  “high impact ” and “expandable” . The latter is  used 
in packaging applications to protect goods during transport and storage.  
07 – O. Other thermoplastics include p olycarbonate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, styrene acrylonitrile, 
polymethyl methacrylate, p olyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl acetate , and many others. They have a wide range of 
uses, but each is produced in much smaller volumes than 01 -06 above.  
 
 Figure 1.7 • Primary chemicals in context  
 
Key message • While most energy consumption in the chemical sector takes pla ce upstream, a host of  
transformations , intermediate s, and e nd-use sectors lie downstream from  primary chemicals.  
Can chemicals be used more efficiently?  
Several strategi es can be pursued to improve the efficiency with which chemicals are used 
throughout the value chain, thereby providing the same final services while consuming fewer 
chemicals  and chemical products . Widespread deployment of such strategies can reduce overa ll 
demand for material. These approaches are often collectively referred to as “material efficiency ” 
strategies . Although many chemicals are gases and liquids (as opposed to durable materials like 
plastic and st eel), the same principles apply (Allwood et al., 2013; Allwood and Cullen, 2012) . 
Examples of relevant measures are:  The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8 
Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers  
 Page | 22 • Re-using products.  For example , using a plastic bottle twice halves the amount of material 
demanded relative to the purchase of a new bottle. This is an especially important strategy for 
products with a short lifetime, as multiple tranches of savings can be achieved rapidly.   
• Recycling.  Providing secondary input materials, so consuming  less virgin material and less 
energy. Plastic recycling is the key example in the chemical sector, but other pockets of 
recycling exist, such as recovery and recycling of the solvent , acetic acid.  
• Using pr oducts more intensively.  Structural materials , such as reinforced composites ( e.g. for 
wind turbine blades) , can be designed to a tighter specification , thereby reducing the amount 
of material required relative to thic ker or over -designed components.  
• Reduc ing material losses along supply chains.  In plastic manufacturing, an array of moulding 
and extrusion processes provide s an efficient way to deploy material exactly where and how it 
is needed, and many can recycle and ut ilise “in -house”  scrap.  
• Increasing product lifetimes . This reduces the rate at which products need replacing and , 
therefore, the cumulative material de mand over  a given time period. This strategy overlaps to 
some extent with the re- use of products.  
• Other strategies , including material subst itution and achieving significant behavioural and/or 
lifestyle changes  so as to reduce absolute demand –  consuming, moving, and using less.  
In the chemical sector, plastics constitute the  main group of material outputs, although many 
material efficiency st rategies also apply to rubber, synthetic fibre , and other durable  products. 
For chemical products that decompose, dilute or otherwise disperse during use, it is more 
difficult to intervene to effect material savings. Examples are  applying fertiliser to managed soils  
or using cosmetic and hygiene products  delivered as aerosols. Especially in these cases , but also 
for durable products, material efficiency strategies that reduce the need to replace the product  
are often the most effective starting point. Refilling plastic containers, repairing rubber tyres , and 
deploying fertilisers efficiently are all examples of strategies that limit the need for recycling .  
The potential of plastic recycling to reduce the demand for primary chemicals is dependent on 
the amount and q uality of available scrap and on the level of recycling achieved.  For several bulk 
materials in other sectors , recycling rates5 are already high: steel and aluminium  around  80% and 
paper around 60%. The rate of non -fibre  plastic recycling is  much lower (though  the data are 
much poorer ). It is estimated that some 18% of available plastic waste (excluding synthetic fibre) 
is currently recycled in some form, although the rate of displacement of virgin resins is much 
lower since  much recycling is  currently “open loop”  (see Box 1.3). The upside of this low recycling 
rate is , of course, that the potential for increas ing plastic recycling is much greater than for 
several other materials.  
Today there are two main categories of plastic recycling: mechanical and chemical recycling, with 
the former being much more widespread.  
Mechanical, or “ back to polymer ”, recycling  offers a simpler and generally lower cost source of 
secondary plastic production, in which the chemical structure of the polymers rem ains intact. 
Collected and sorted plastic waste is the feed material, which is then cleaned, cut up into chips, 
and re -melted ready for mo ulding. Some impurities often remain after cleaning, including various 
additives used in virgin plastics to yield cert ain properties. For instance , isophthalic acid is often 
used as an additive in PET bottles to reduce their crystallinity, thereby improving the clarity and 
transparency. If the PET resin in the bottle is to be recycled and used for other purposes where 
this characteristic is no longer required, the additive –  often deeply embedded in the chemical

Page | 23 structure of the product – can become an inhibiting impurity , rather than a helpful additive. 
These impurities can result in lower -performance in recycled materials, relative to their virgin 
counterparts. The colouring used in virgin plastics presents a further – but mainly aesthetic – 
challenge. Two plastics of the same chemical composition, but differing colours , are very difficult 
to separate using existing indus trial sorting processes. In mixed waste streams , where thousands 
of colours of plastics are encountered, the consequence tends to be that resins of multiple 
colours are recycled together. This often  limits the choice of the colour of the final product to 
black. This  sounds trivial, but it has a significant impact on the extent to which recycled material 
can displace virgin production.  
Chemical, or “back to monomer ”, recycling  describes a group of processes in which the plastic 
waste is converted back to th e chemical building blocks that produced the original virgin 
material. This involves chemical transformations, calling for complex industrial processing 
equipment, and thus is generally more capital- intensive than is mechanical recycling . The key 
advantage  of chemical recycling is that the quality obtained in secondary plastic production is  
often equal to that of virgin production, enabling the same product to be recycled many times. 
The difficulty , though , is that the process economics tend to be less favo urable relative to the 
virgin production routes for the same plastic. As a result this route is not yet followed  at an 
industrial scale globally (Rahimi and García, 2017) .  
 Box 1.3 • Material cycles: C ircular, open and closed loops  
A product or material is said to b e recycled or reused in a closed loop if it is returned at the end of its initial 
lifetime in a fit state  to fulfil the service for which it was originally produced.  Open -loop  recycling  describes 
that which enables a second lifetime for the material used i n the original  product , but at least some is used to 
produce a different product from the original.  A material or product is described as  circular (or exhibiting 
circularity) if it completes the closed loop without loss. Technically, most products can be returned to their 
original chemical components. However, few materials or products are circular in today’s  supply chains, due 
to material losses during use and disposal.  
PET drinks bottles for water and soft drinks are an example of a chemical product that  is reused and recycled, 
but in vary ing degrees of open and closed loops. To take three of many possible pathways:  
1) A drinks bottle can be purchased and re- used multiple times, either directly by the consumer or after return 
to the vendor for cleaning a nd re -filling, forming an entirely closed  loop on a material basis. Several coun tries 
and states ( e.g. Germany and California) have incentives in place to encourage consumers to collect and 
return plastic bottles. These schemes are even more common for gla ss bottles.  
2) The bottle can be sent to a chemical recycling facility where it is broken down into its key chemical building 
blocks and re- manufactured to form a new bottle from the basic monomers . So-called “bottle -to-bottle ” 
recycling is a form of back -to-monomer recycling.  
3) Again, the bottle can be returned to a recycling facility, chipped, melted and re- manufactured to form 
polyester fibre. Fibre is a lower grade end -use of PET, where slightly lower grades of polymer purity  can be 
tolerated  relativ e to food - or bottle -grade resin. This means the recycled product cannot be re -used in its 
origin al application. Because of this  and the fact that there is no large -scale outlet for recycling PET fibre , even 
this imperfect recycle loop occurs only once. T his type of recycling is often referred to as “ downcycling ” and is 
an example of open -loop recycling.  
 
Beyond  recycling and reuse, other material efficiency strategies are thought to have limited 
potential when it comes to plastics. Conversion losses in the major chemical production 
processes are close to their theoretical minimums. With energy accounting for a s ignificant 
portion of operating costs , there is a long history of continuous technological progress in catalysis The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8

minimis ing production costs and improving competiti veness.  
Light -weighting of plastic products is often already carried out to its practical limit . Thinner plastic 
bottles and carrier bags serve to reduce the amount of plastic required for containing and 
transporting consumer goods, but further gains are limited by material properties and 
practicalities. Underpinning the successful deployment of these strategies are effective design 
principles ( e.g. design for disassembly) , often supported by  regulations. Illustrating the 
application of a necessary environ mental constraint, however, in many count ries, there is a 
minimum requirement for the thickness of a plastic bag (typically 40 -50 microns), without which 
they become fragmented  in waste streams and difficult to sort and collect.  
Fertiliser s are integral to  our modern agricultural systems, improving yields and limiting diseases. 
But there can be too much of a good thing. “ Fertiliser  efficiency”  is usually defined as increase in 
yield achieved per unit of fertiliser applied. Because soil conditions and desired crops vary 
considerably with climate and location, there is no single optimal target value for the amount of 
fertiliser to be applied.   
In Western Europe, with  respect to nitrogen fertilisers specifically (the most energy -intensive to 
produce), country studies from the 1990s found that fertiliser application  could be reduced by 
44% , without nutritional loss,  when applied more efficiently (Worrell, Meuleman and Blok, 199 5). 
Between 1987 and 2007,  nitrogen fertiliser  use per hectare in the European  Union  declined by 
more than half;  and in China it is estimated that a reduction of 30 -50% could take place without 
reducing crop yields (Good and Beatty, 2011) .   
Seven chemical  building blocks underpin a vast industry  
Despite the substantial complexity of the chemical sector, only seven primary chemicals –  
ammonia, methanol, ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, and mixed xylenes – provide the key 
building blocks on which the bulk of the chemical industry is based. These p rimary chemicals 
account for approximately two -thirds  of the sector’s total consumption  of final energy products . 
Ammonia  (NH 3) is the starting compound for all nitrogen -containing fertilisers. At ambient 
condi tions, it is a toxic colo urless gas with a pungent smell;  but in water solutions , it can be 
treated without much difficulty.  Globally, more  than half of ammonia is converted to urea, which 
is in turn mainly used as a fertiliser, but it also has industrial applications. Ammonia and urea are 
often produced in integrated or co -located facilities  since  the large quantity of concentrated CO 2 
released during the manufacture of ammonia is used as an input to urea production. In 
aggregate, agricultural uses account  for approximately 80% of total ammonia demand, but 
ammonia also serves as a chemical building block in several industrial applications, explosives , 
and cleaning products. Global ammonia production is approximately  185 million  tonnes  per year 
(Mt/yr). 
Methanol (CH 3OH) is a light, colourless and odourless liquid that is highly flammable. Methanol is 
most common ly used to make other chemicals . About 4 0% is converted to formaldehyde  and 
further processed into plastics, plywood, paints, explosives and textiles.  It is also used in anti-
freeze, solvents  and fuels for vehicles , and it can serve as an energy carrier. Methanol can also be 
converted to other primary chemicals. Global methanol production is approximately 100 Mt/yr.  
Ethylene  (C2H4) and propylene  (C3H6) – collectively referred to as light olefins  – are reactive 
compounds widely used, for example , in the production of polymers to manufacture plastics. The 
largest derivative of each of these olefins is their simplest polymer derivative : polyethylene and 
polypropylene. Combined global ethylene and propylene production is approximately 2 55 Mt/yr. © OECD/IEA 201 8 The Future of Petrochemicals  
 Towards more s ustainable plastics and fertilis ers 
    
Page | 25 Benzene  (C6H6), toluene  (C7H8) and mixed x ylene s (C8H10) – collectively referred to as BTX 
aromatics  – can be also easily modified, and have a s pecific smell that prompted the use of 
“aromatics” as a name. They are used in health and hygiene, food production and processing, 
transportation, information technology and other sectors. Global production of BTX aromatics i s 
appr oximately 1 10 Mt/yr.  
Light olefins and aromatics are referred to collectively as HVC s. The market p rices of HVC s are  
typically a multiple of those of methanol or ammonia. This is , in large part , because they are 
mainly made from oil, which tends to be more expensive than the gas a nd coal used for ammonia 
and methanol production , an aspect that is explored further in the discussion of feedstocks in 
Chapter  2. 
Key production processes  
HVCs  are produced either in multi-  or single -product processes in the chemical sector ; 
alternatively , they are sourced as by -products from refinery operations. Ethylene, propylene and 
BTX aromatics are co -produced in steam crackers . Whereas ethylene is produced almost 
exclusively in the chemical sector in steam crackers , propylene is sourced in large quantities as a 
by-product of refining operations , specifically , of fluid catalytic cracking . The majority of BTX 
aromatics are  sourced from FCC and continuous catalytic reforming  units in refineries.  The 
dominant processes for producing propylene as a single  product are propane dehydrogenation 
and olefin metathesis . Olefins can also be produced from methanol using the 
methanol -to-olefins  process although this is done only in China , where abundant access to coal 
sufficiently lowers the cost of producing methan ol. Aromatics can also be produced via a similar 
route, although this process is still at the demonstration phase.  
The key process for producing both ammonia and methanol is steam reforming  of natural gas. 
Although the synthesis step that takes place after this process differs for each chemical –  Haber 
Bosch synthesis for ammonia and methanol synthesis at various pressures –  the need for 
hydrogen -containing synthesis gas is common to both . Oil feedstocks, such as naphtha, liquefied 
petroleu m gas and fuel oil, can also be used, either with steam reforming or via a similar route to 
synthesis gas –  partial oxidation. Again, China uniquely  uses  coal as a feedstock for producing 
both methanol and ammonia. Coal must first undergo gasification  befo re synthesis gas can be 
obtained, which is highly energy -intensive.

Page | 27 Chapter 2. Chemicals and the energy system  
As in society, chemicals play an important role in the energy system. The chemical sector is the 
largest in dustrial energy consumer, ahead of iron and steel, and cement. It accounts for 
approximately 10% of total final energy consumption and almost 30% of industrial final energy 
consumption. The chemical sector is also the largest industrial consumer of both oil and gas, 
accounting for 1 4% and 8% of total primary demand for each fuel respectively. Within the 
chemical sector, p rimary chemicals account for almost 90% of the consumption of oil and gas.  
Total primary demand for oil is dominated by the demand for liquid fuels in transport for fuelling 
cars, trucks, ships and planes, which account s for almost 60% globally. T he chemical sector is the 
next- largest source of oil demand,  accounting for 14 % of primary demand. By contrast,  power 
generation dominates pr imary  demand for natural gas (40 %), followed by demand for space and 
water heating in buildings (21%). The chemical sector, accounting for 8% of total demand for 
natural gas,  uses twice as much as the entire transport sector.

Key message •  Petrochemicals  account for 1 4% and 8% of total primary demand for oil and gas 
respectively.  
From feedstock to chemical products  
As noted earlier, f uels are  consumed in two ways in the chemical sector: as energy to drive 
processes  and as “ feedstock” . Process energy consumption in the chemical sector is similar to 
that in other industrial sectors : fuels are consumed to  provid e direct heat, steam and el ectricity 
to drive the sector’s processes, equipment and facilities. The use of fuels as  feedstock is unique 
to the chemical sector and is integral to understanding how the sector performs its role.  
“Feedstock”  describes the use of various fuels  as a mater ial input. Akin to iron ore inputs to the 
iron and steel industry or alumina inputs to the aluminium industry, chemical feedstock is the 
source of the carbon and hydrogen used physically to constitute chemical products. Feedstoc k is 
quantified in energy un its because , before use, it is indistinguishable from the same energy 
products used as fuels. But , once feedstock undergoes transformation in the chemical sector , it is 
easier to think of it as a material, with its carbon and hydrogen atoms re arranged  physically to 
constitute the plastics and other chemical products manufactured within the sector.  
Chemical feeds tock accounts for more than half the  total energy inputs to the chemical sector 
globally. The vast majority of feedstock consumed from 1970 until today  has been  in the form of 
fossil fuels, with oil, natural gas and coal contributing  cumulative shares of approximately 7 4%, 8%

suggests  a steady increase in process energy efficiency and integration, relative to feedstock 
requirements . Reduction s in feedstock requirements are  limited by chemistry. However, there 
may be other influencing factors , such as the complex ities involved in reporting on feedstock use . 
 Figure 2.2 • Feedstock and process energy consumption in the chemical sector  
 
Source:  IEA (2017), World Energy Balances . 
Key message • Today, feedstock accounts for  just over half of  the sector’s energy inputs.  
 Box 2.1 • Chemical feedstock: E nergy or material?  
Whereas the main inputs and outputs to say, the iron and steel sector (iron ore in, steel out) are 
unequivocally recognised as materials, the same cannot be said of the chemical sector. Chemicals form a 
bridge between the energy system and consumers’ vehic les, homes and plates. Chemical f eedstock consists 
of molecules of oil, natural gas and other carbon - and hy drogen -containing minerals, which are extracted 
from the ground and processed  to end up physically constituting, for example, the million or so plas tic 
bottles the world currently produce d every minute  (Laville and Taylor, 2017) . Feedstock is also embedded 
in the synthetic fibre, rubber, detergents and other chemical products we use every day to manufacture 
packaging, carpets, cars, cutlery, electroni c goods, toothbrushes, clothes and a plethora of other consumer 
goods. We are surrounded by chemical products and,  theref ore, also by chemical feedstock.  
At first glance , it appears that feedstock can be consigned to the “ material”  category. Alas, the picture is 
more complex. When entering the chemical sector as a fuel, feedstock is measured in energy units and 
accounted for in energy statistics. This is because,  at that point , it is indistinguishable on a molecular level 
from its p rocess energy counterparts. In other words, it could still be burned to release energy, just like any 
other fuel. A further complication arises, in that the feedstock can also play a role in the process energy 
requirements. Some u nconve rted feedstock in by -products is  recirculated and used as fuel inputs.  
Molecules of feedstock often release energy as they are rearranged and reassembled in the chemical 
supply chain.  
To complete the circle, feedstock embedded in chemical products can often return to somethin g more like 
a store of energy. Plastic and other chemical product waste is frequently burned in waste -to-energy 
facilities  in order  to generate electricity and heat. Perhaps the easiest way to consider feedstock is to think 
of it as akin to wood. Like the oil and gas used for chemical feedstock, wood can be used both as a material 
and as  a fuel. Charcoal and other forms of biomass made from wood appear in energy statistics and are 
measured in energy units. Conversely, and again like feedstock, timber –  a wo od product , analogous to 
plastic – is used to construct buildings and other end- use products, which it would be strange to quantify in 
energy units (this house contains “ 𝑥𝑥 gigajoules” of timber, as opposed to “ 𝑥𝑥 tonnes ”). Feedstock is to the 
chemical industry what wood is to carpentry.

Page | 29 Approximately 1 2 million barrels per day ( mb/d ) of oil products, 10 5 billion cubic metres ( bcm ) of 
natural gas and 8 0 million  tonnes  (Mt) of coal enter the sector as feedstock and undergo a 
complex series of chemical transformations, eventually leaving the sector embedded in chemical 
products.  
• More than 90% of the oil – most ly in the form of ethane or  naphtha – entering the chemical 
sector as feedstock is transformed into high -value chemicals  (HVCs) . Very small amount s are  
used for methanol and ammonia production, with the rest being used for other chemicals, 
notably , carbon black.  
• About 25 % of gas demand for chemical feedstock is used to produce methanol, with the 
majority of the rest used to produce ammonia.  
• Coal feedstock usage is split in fairly even proportions across methanol and ammonia .  
Approximately 190 Mt of chemicals, two-thirds  of which are HVCs , are also produced as by -
products in the refining sector, making  their way into the chemical sector for further processing. 
The remain der of these refinery chemicals, butylene  – also produced as a co -product in steam 
cracking within the chemical sector  – is used for various fuel applications and forms the base of 
most synthetic rubber.  
Nitrogen fertilisers, p lastic s, synthetic fibre s and rubber account for more than 70% of the total 
mass production  of chemicals . The remainder of the product s consist  of a host of monomers and 
other intermediate chemicals that go on to be transformed into thousands of small volu me 
downstream chemicals and products. The complexity at the margins in the chemical sector is 
hard to overstate. T he European Chemicals Agency (a regulatory body)  track s more than  100 000 
unique substances. Many of these substances are produced using prima ry chemicals and their 
derivatives.  
The total mass of chemical products leaving the chemical sector is larger than the mass  of 
feedstock entering it. This is because in addition to feedstock (mainly composed of carbon and 
hydrogen), many chemical products contain other elements (mainly oxygen, nitrogen and 
chlorine) that are added at various points in the supply chain. I n mass terms , these other 
compounds comprise  around  a billion  tonnes , although their exact quantit y is uncertain. The 
magnitude of these secondary material flows is a key reason why the sector is so 
energy -intensive. Heating, cooling, moving and separating these substances , in addition to the 
feedstock and the primary chemicals , consumes large amounts of process energy.  
Another question is the extent to which these secondary material flows can be re -absorbed in 
the production of other chemicals , although it is known that this practice is already widespread in 
some parts of the supply chain. For example, the carbon dioxide  (CO 2) by-product from ammonia 
manufacture (process emissions) is used as a raw material input to urea manufacture on a large 
scale.  Although many chemical operations are integrated to achieve a high  degree of efficiency in 
resource use within a n individua l facility, the full potential for the use of by -products from one 
process as inputs to another across the industry as a whole is difficult  to ascertain . 
In addition to the principal chemical production pathways sh own in Figure  2.3, there are others 
that play a marginal role today , globally. For instance, recycling thermoplastics can reduce 
demand for primary chemicals and , thus, save energy and CO 2 emissions. For each tonne of 
polyethylene recycled (the most common plastic used in packaging), more than 1  tonne of 
ethylene demand can be eliminated , saving at least 1. 5 tonnes of oil -equivalent (toe) . Bio -based 
feedstock can also displace fossil fuel feedstock or replace derivative chemicals further down the 
value chain. These alternative s offer promising pote ntial to support the decoupling of chemicals 
production from CO 2 emissions, in part due to their relatively low current  levels of penetration.  The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8

Source:  Adapted from  Levi, P.G. and J.M. Cullen (2018), “Mapping global flows of chemicals: From fossil fuel feedstocks to chemical 
products”, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b04573 . 
Key mess age • More than 50 0 million  tonnes  of oil -equivalent (Mtoe) of feedstock is consumed per year 
to make nearly 1  billion  tonnes  of chemical products. Oil is the dominant feedstock for HVC s, whereas gas 
and coal are used for ammonia and methanol.  
Globally  in 2017 , recycling of major plast ic resins is estimated to have reached 1 6% of available  
waste, while global production capacity of bio -plastics stood at just over 2  Mt (European 
Bioplastics, 2018)  (the latter equivalent to  less than 1% of annual global plastic demand, if fully 
utilised). Theoretically, t he chemical sector could do without fossil fuels altogether, but feedstock 
containing  carbon and hydrogen will remain a requirement.  
What determines  the selection of feedstock?  
For much of the history of the chemical industry, primary chemicals could be made only from 
oil and natural gas. M odern chem istry and industrial processing p ermits  most energy products 
to be converted into most primary chemicals, either directly or via secondary processing. 
Ammonia and methanol can be made directly from oil, natural gas, coal, bio -energy, and even 
water  (by splitting water molecu les to make hy drogen, although methanol requires a separate 
source of carbon  because  none is available in the water molecules). HVCs  can be made from oil 
directly, but also from all the other fuels listed above via methanol. This last element of 
flexibility in the suppl y chain is a relatively recent development , following the 
commercialis ation of methanol conversion processes . Methanol -to-olefins (MTO) is now 
commercial, whereas the more challenging transformation from methanol -to-aromatics is still 
at the pilot plant stage (Bazzanella and Ausfelder, 2017) .  © OECD/IEA 201 8 The Future of Petrochemicals  
 Towards more s ustainable plastics and fertilis ers 
    
Page | 31 Despite this innovation and flexibility , not all routes are equally competitive , which explains the 
dominance  of fossi l fuels in  today’s demand for chemical feedstock. Ethane ( North  America and 
the Middle  East ) and naphtha (Europe and Asia) are the principal feedstocks  used to make 
HVCs , whereas natural gas is the key input  for producing methanol and ammonia globally, 
except in the People’s Republic of China,6 where coal is dominant for both. The overarching 
consideration in the selection of  feedstock and process routes is the production cost , allowing 
for equipment costs and process yields, though there are also other factors at play, some of 
which are regional, including feedstock availability, labour costs and the regulatory 
environment . 
Process equipment costs, excluding engineering and installation costs, tend to be fairly uniform 
regionally for a given technology  because  there are relatively few vendors  available and 
therefore little variation among offerings. However, overall costs vary significantly between the 
process routes available, which are distinguished , primarily , by the feedstock they utilise. 
Equipment  for producing chemicals from solid feedstock, primarily coal and biomass, tend s to 
be more capital -intensive than equipment for producing the same product from natural gas. 
Using ammonia as an example, for a unit of production, equipment costs using coal are more 
than twice as high as  natural gas, whereas biomass equipment  costs are nearly sevenfold  
higher .    
Process yields refer to the amount of product that can be obtained  per unit of feedstock 
consumed, and  are one of the most important determinants of  the choice of  route  because  
they directly affect both feedstock and process energy consumption . For the simultaneous 
production of HVC s from the same process run (“co -production” or “multi -product processes”) , 
ethane as a feedstock offers the highest yiel ds, using only 1. 2 tonnes  of feedstock per tonne 
(t/t) of HVC s produced. The introduction of catalysts in steam cracking can deliver yield gains of 
about 20% when using naphtha as feedstock.

BDH is in terms of bioethanol.  
Key message • Multiple feedstocks can be utilised to make the same product, but with significant 
variations between the amount of input required.  
Routes that produce selected HVCs individually can consume relatively low amounts of 
feedstock per unit of product, especially when using a feedstock of similar chemical structure

 Page | 32 to the product, such as the case of propane dehydr ogenation (PDH) to produce propylene. To 
produce both ammonia and methanol, natural gas offers the highest yields. Bioenergy -based 
routes are typically more feedstock -intensive compared to their fossil- based counterparts due 
to their lower carbon and energ y content.  
In co -production processes, there is typically a compromise between the overall amount of HVCs  
produced (process yield)  and the diversity of products (ethylene, propylene and benzene, toluene 
and mixed xylenes ( BTX) aromatics) obtained. For exam ple, while an ethane steam cracker yields 
about 50% more HVC s than a naphtha -based one, the mix of HVCs  produced is predominantly  
composed of ethylene . In contrast, naphtha steam cracking delivers a more balanced portfolio of 
ethylene, propylene and BTX ar omatics, but at a lower yield rate than the ethane- based route. 
The differences are  mainly due to the degree of similarity between the chemical structure of the 
feedstock and the final product. The relative level of demand for the different HVCs  can, 
therefore , be an important factor in feedstock selection. Single -product  processes can be used to 
fill the gaps left by the use of relatively cheap, locally available feedstock.  
 Figure 2.5 • Yield of individual HVCs  in multi- product processes  
 
Key message • Higher overall yields are often obtained at the expense of a balanced product profile.  
The main determinant for the choice of route to produce a particular product is the availability 
(and therefore , cost) of feedstocks , which varies  substantially between regions. Whereas crude 
oil has a similar price across the globe, natural gas prices can vary by a factor of 4 . 
Furthermore, despite the global market for oil, many of the lighter  products – ethane and LPG , 
in particular – are eit her unavailable in some reg ions  or are imported at significant additional 
cost. Natural gas tends to be more expensive than coal and oil products more costly than 
natural gas.  
Feedstock costs can represent anywhere between 15% and 85% of the levelised production 
costs of HVCs , depe nding on the feedstock choice. The price s of feedstocks and process energy 
inputs vary over time, according to the market d ynamics  of supply and demand . The surge in 
supply of  ethane in the United  States  as the shale ga s revolution picked up momentum  led t o a 
fall in ethane prices after 2011, to th e extent that “ethane rejection”  (ethane being left un -
extracted from natural gas streams) became commonplace.  
For the production of  HVCs , ethane crackers offer the consistently cheapest route  from a 
simplified levelised cost perspective;  but these units yield few products aside from ethylene, 
whereas naphtha and MTO units provide a more balanced slate of propylene, ethylene and 
aromatics. In both 2010 and 2017  – before and after the US  shale gas revolution upend ed oil

based steam cracking between the Middle  East  and the United  States  decreas ed more than 
three fold between 2010 and 2017 as a result of the shale revolution. Before the slump in oil 
prices in 2014, Chinese MTO plants (using methanol as feedstock) offered a substantial 
discount , relative to the cheapest naphtha cracker (nearly USD 300 per tonne of high value 
chemical ( tHVC )), whereas in 2017 this discount decreased almost to zero .

Notes:  Fuel and feedstock costs are calculated based on average prices during both 2010 and 2017, whereas capital expenditure 
(CAPEX) and fixed operational expenditure (OPEX) are a ssumed to remain constant both over time and between regions, for a given 
technology. CAPEX assumptions: USD 1 500 /tHVC for ethane steam cracking; USD 1 000/t HVC for MTO;  USD 2 050/t HVC for naphtha 
steam cracking. Fixed OPEX: 2.5 -5.0% of CAPEX. Discount rate is 8%. A 25 year design life is assumed for all equipment. Energy  
performance ranges: 12 -19 gigajoules  (GJ)/tHVC for nap htha steam cracking; 14 -17 GJ/tHVC for naphtha steam cracking; 1 1 GJ/tHVC

Key message • Among the main costs of production, feedstock is the most influential factor in 
determining regional production advantages.  
These cost dynamics determine,  to some extent , where primary chemical production takes 
place around the world. Regions with an advantageous feedstock position ( e.g. Middle  East  and 
United  States  for HVCs ) tend to contribute large volumes to the global production of primary 
chemicals . Asia  Pacific  accounts for half of global primary chemical production ( 326 Mt per 
year ), with China as by far the largest chemicals producer in Asia, accounting for 20%, 33% and 
55% of HVC s, ammonia and methanol global capacity , respectively . Because of the very limited 
availability of feedstock from natural gas liquids in China –  the country’s natural gas output not 
being rich in these substances -- China depends heavily on naphtha feedstock (more than 90%) 
for HVCs.  
This also explains why Chinese refinery LPG yields are some of the highest in the world – close 
to 10%. Despite this, China has significantly ramped up LPG imports to feed PDH plants 
dedicated to  propylene production in recent years. China’s f eedstock deficit from indigenous 
petroleum s ources has incentivised coal- to-olefin project develop ments, which has increasingly 
brought coal companies into petrochemical operations. Interestingly, the Saudi petrochemical 
holding,  SABIC , has announced a joint venture plan with Shenhua, the large st coal producer in 
China, in the coal -to-chemica ls field. The abundance and low price of coal in China means that , 
despite higher equipment costs and lower selectivity compared to natural gas, it is also 
advantageous in terms of production cost to obtain ammonia and methanol from coal. The 
development of a coal -based chemical industry in China has helped lower  production costs for  0 300 600 9001 2001 5001 800USD/t HVCEthane feedstock

 Page | 34 some chemicals, although capacity utilisation rates tend to be quite low, indicating  over -
capacity and some sub -optimal deployment of assets.  
The Middle  East is generally at the lower en d of the cost curve among producing regions for 
primary chemical production. Currently, the region has 12%, 9% and 15 % of the world’s 
production capacity for HVCs , ammonia and methanol , respectively . The region  is thought to 
have strong potential growth. O f the region’s total crude oil production (about 2 8 mb/d), only 
about 7 mb/d is refined locally, with the rest exported  to global markets. Over 90% of naphtha 
output is also exported rather than  being used locally as feedstock, partly as a result of the ample 
availability  of far cheaper alternatives , such as ethane and LPG, which together make up more 
than half of regional HVC  feedstock.  
Europe holds a large , but declining, segment of global production capacity for  primary chemicals. 
Once the largest regi on for chemical production, it now accounts for more modest shares of the 
world’s production capacity: 15% for HVCs , 12% for ammonia  and 3% for methanol . However, the 
region retains a strong position in high -value market segments  further downstream  (cosmet ics, 
consumer chemicals , etc.), which sustains  several upstream assets, despite the region being high 
up the cost curve for most primary chemicals.  
The United  States  remains a key source of primary chemicals among developed countries, and it 
is expected to remain competitive across  many segments in future. It hosts  16% of the world’s 
HVC  production capacity , 7% of ammonia and 5% of methanol. The United  States  is rapidly 
expanding its petrochemical capacity , thanks to the shale revolution, which has led to  natural gas 
liquid s (NGL s) production doubling to nearly 4  mb/d in five years. Unsurprisingly, ethane and LPG 
dominate  the feedstock mix for HVCs , accounting for 5 5% and 3 4%, respec tively, with naphtha  
holding less than a 10% share.

Page | 35 Chemicals: T raded commodities  
Trade in chemical products takes place at several points along the value chain , enabl ing 
producers to focus on aspects in which  they can maintain a comp etitive advantage.  Trade in 
primary chemicals tends to be modest relative to that of the  downstream derivatives, mainly 
because of high transportation costs and low margins. A step along  the derivative chain 
(e.g. from ethylene to polyethylene) not only adds value but often re sults in easier 
transportation.  
Where the equipment and capital are accessible, producers tend to add value by moving down 
the derivative chain. Trade data in the two largest -volume primary chemicals and their largest -
volume derivatives show a relatively similar pattern  over the last ten years. Global ammonia 
production in 2016 was  180 Mt, of which the  globally traded volume was  roughly 10- 15 Mt, or 
about 7%. Over the previous decade t rade volumes declined sligh tly, both in absolute terms and 
as a share of production, which stood at about 10% in 2006 but , overall, have remained relatively 
flat. The pattern of trade has  also remained relatively  consistent, with three of the top five 
exporters , and four of the top  five importers , maintaining similar positions . 
Urea is the largest -volume derivative of ammonia, consuming more than half of the  annual 
production  of ammonia. It is more expensive than ammonia  because  it offers greater nutrient 
value (nitrogen) per tonne as a fertiliser, creating an additional margin  for urea producers. 
Because ammonia  is a gas at ambient conditions  and urea is a solid, urea is also easier to 
transport, giving urea export a cost advantage  relative to exporting ammonia.7 This is reflected in 
global trade volumes of urea, which, in absolute terms, were approximately 60% highe r than 
those of ammonia in 2006  and more than 300% higher in 2016. Ethylene and its largest -volume 
derivative , polyethylene, tell a similar story.

Page | 37 Supply of oil feedstock for chemicals and integration opportunities  
Oil prod ucts used as chemical feedstock may come from refinery operations or NGL fractionation.  
In volume terms, oil demand for chemical feedstock is dominated globally by the fractionation 
products of NGLs . Refi neries do not produce ethane to any meaningful extent, and their LP G 
yields are typically below 5% . Thus , ethane, which accounts for almost a third of all chemical 
feedstock , and most of the LPG used as chemical feedstock , are supplied by NGL fractionation 
plants. In contrast, refineries provide the bulk of heavier feedstocks, including naphtha, which is 
the most popular feedstock, and other distillates. Average refinery naphtha yields are around 7%.  
 Figure 2.9 • Destinations of oil pro ducts from NGL fractionation and refineries  
 
Notes:  The line thicknesses in the diagram are sized according to volume,  and are indicative. Biofuels are excluded. Other sources of 
liquid fuels , such as coal liquefaction and gas to liquids are excluded.  
Key message • Refineries are only a secondary source of feedstock to the petrochemical sector, with 
most feedstock coming  from N GL fractionation.  
The proportion of chemical feedstocks sourced from refineries is limited,  not only because  an 
average barrel of c rude oil contains only a limited amount of light fractions (LPG), but also 
because of competition for straight -run yields of light distillates (naphtha) for gasoline 
blendstocks , to supplement that part  coming from the upgrading of residual oils. Moreover , LPG 
and naphtha usually  have negative margins (i.e. priced lower than crude oil) , discouraging  
refineries from increasing  their yields. In other words, t hese products are essentially by -products 
of a process that is geared  to producing the transport fuels , gasoline , and middle distillates 
(diesel and kerosene)  that dominate the refinery output product slate.  It is their processing 
margins that determine the economic case for refineries to operate.  
However, global averages mask significant regional variations. Refinery yields of both LPG and 
naphtha are higher in regions where local supplies of NGLs are relatively low. In Asia, for 
example, NGL output is only 1 mb/d, just 6% of the global total, while total demand for ethane, 
LPG and naphtha is more than 8  mb/d. This means that Asian petrochemical manufacture is more 
reliant on  naphtha, which can be supplied by refineries in higher volumes than LPG or ethane. 
This is one reason why Asia accounts for about 60% of global naphtha consumption as 
petrochemical feedstock.  But, despite higher naphtha yields, the region is still a large net 
importer of naphtha  and LPG from the Middle  East and Europe .

 Page | 38 Asian operators have also started importing L PG and ethane f or feedstock use  in PDH plants and 
steam crackers, respectively. The bulk of incremental imports have come from the U nited  States , 
due to the  attractive prices available at the  US export hubs. Such s eaborne ethane shipments are 
a very recent phenomenon, in itially going  from the  United  States  to European and Indian steam 
crackers. The intention to import US ethane has  also been announced by several Chinese 
companies. Even so,  the use of naphtha in Asian petrochemical feedstock is not expected to 
decline sign ificantly, because of  the sheer sc ale of feedstock demand growth.  
Asian refineries ’ intake of US light tight oil is also growing.  After  the US ban on crude oil exports 
was lifted in late 2015, US crude oil exports skyrocketed to  1.1 mb/d in 2017.  Of these, more than 
one-third ha s arrived at Asian refineries, many of which  are integrated with petrochemical 
facilities. In several months during the course of 2017, China surpassed Canada as the largest 
buyer of US crude oil. Echoing this dynamic , a growing supply of condensate is triggering 
investments in condensate splitters  in the United  States  and Asia, enabling higher naphtha yields.  
Upstream integration  
Chem ical production can be integrated with the sourcing of its feedstock: either with refineries  or 
NGL fractionation plants. Refineries are the more complex case and , therefore, the focus of this 
section. In any event, no single factor explains why chemical producers would choose to opt for 
upstream8 integrat ion, and what works well in one region may no t be a good recipe for another.

Key message • Production of petrochemical feedstock alone is not profitable for refineries.  
For refineries with integrated petrochemical operations, the commercial and economic 
conditions are different. One obvious benefit is the reduction in the transp ort costs for 
feedstock. As a result,  steam crackers are often located in the same industrial hub as refinery 
sites , even when the ownership differs.  Combining these assets within  a single entity’s 
portfolio saves  corporate overheads and staff costs, as we ll as providing potential synergies in 
utility  supply and logistics infrastructure. The most important benefit comes from matching the 
complementarities in  energy supply and demand requirements.

Page | 39 Not only is l ow-value refinery out put, such as naphtha,  a valuable feedstock for petrochemical 
processes ( e.g. steam cracking), but a by -product of steam cracking, hydrogen, is a vital input into 
a refinery’s desulphurisation units : the higher the sulphur content in the crude oil being 
processed, the bigger th e hydrogen requirement to meet increasingly stringent sulphur content 
limits in transport fuels. Refineries extract some hydrogen from naphtha reforming, but usually 
this is not sufficient. In these instances hydrogen is purchased to fill the gap. Other by -products 
of steam cracking, such as pyrolysis gasoline, can be further processed in refineries for use  as 
gasoline components. In addition, integrated refinery -petrochemical processing may allow 
increased flexibility in the choice of crude oil feedstock, thus expanding the range of crude oil 
qualities that can be profitably processed in the refinery in different market conditions.  
 Figure 2.11 • Propylene and BTX aromatics production in the refining sector  
 
Note: CSA = Central and South America . 
Key message • Regions with lighter feedstocks tend to source more of their propylene and BTX from 
refineries.  
Refineries also produce certain amounts of HVC s, such as propylene and BTX aromatics , directly 
from catalytic cr acking and reforming processes. T hese can accoun t for 1 -2% of a refinery’s yield. 
More than 40% of propylene and around 80% of BTX aromatics are estimated to be sourced from 
refineries globally. Given the relationship between the feedstock used and product yields, where  
the share of heavier feedstock ( e.g. naphtha) used in the petrochemical industry in a given region  
is large , the proportion  of propylene and BTX aromatics produced in refineries  tends to be lower. 
The demand for these HVCs  does not usually  dictate the operating regime of the refining 
processe s in which they are co -produced, which  are normally geared towards maximising 
gasoline and middle distillate outputs.  
A trend is emerging for oil companies to expand  their business portfolio into petroc hemicals , in 
search of higher and more resilient sources of income . This may involve co -located or integrated 
facilities or investment in standalone NGL feedstock crackers . Different levels of operational 
integration can be achieved , up to a full integration aiming  to maximise chemical yields across 
the operation . New direct crude -oil-to-chemicals technologies expand  the opportunities for deep 
operational integration.  
The level and type of integration between refining and petrochemical operations varies by 
region. Europe and Asia both depend on crude oil feedstock imports and have  limited  local  
availability of NGL s. Under these circumstances, the case for operational integration is strong. In 
the United  States  and the Middle  East , ready availability of low -cost NGL, especially ethane, 
means that the direct upstream -to-petrochemical route is the prevailing option.  0%20%40%60%80%100%

Key message • For integrated refiners, the petrochemical path can offer higher margins than  fuels.  
China has the highest level of refining and petrochemical integration  globally. More than 
three -quarters of the production capacity of HVCs is owned by and takes place in the vicinity of 
refineries. Sinopec, a Chinese oil and gas company that is the world’s largest refiner, accounts 
for half on its own. Facilities tend to b e located in the coastal provinces. A notable exception 
arises in the case of methanol- based routes to HVCs, which rely indirectly on coal as feedstock. 
The larger among these plants are located inland, close to coal reserves. One indicator of the 
general tendency for integration is the fact that the names of most Chinese refineries, whether 
independent or owned by state -owned oil companies, are more correctly translated into 
English using the word “petrochemical” rather than “refinery”.  
China also provide s interesting examples of so -called “reverse integration”. In these instances, 
it is the petrochemical company that is moving upstream, rather than the refinery moving 
downstream. A major fabric company in China, Hengli Group, which is a supplier to global  
apparel brands, is not only building a petrochemical- oriented 400  kb/d refinery in Dalian, 
Liaoning province, but has been looking to purchase stakes in Abu Dhabi oil fields. HengYi 
Petrochemical is another striking example. Initially a synthetic textile company, it expanded 
into synthetic fibre manufacturing and then moved further upstream. Currently the company is 
building a refinery in Brunei, geared towards producing petrochemical feedstock for export to 
China. The choice of an overseas location reflec ts, in part, the regulated crude oil import quota 
system in China. Brunei is close to the oil shipping routes through the straits of Malacca.   0  500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500NaphthaDieselGasoline

Key message • China’s petrochemical capacity follows refinery placement, with naphtha crackers 
concentrated in the 1 1 coastal provinces, while methanol -based output tends to be located in coal -
producing regions.  
While the Middle  East  ranks as the third -largest petrochemical producer, its level of 
petrochemical/refinery integration  is low compared to other regions. This may change. In 
recent years , the largest Middle  East ern oil companies have announced ambitious expansion 
programmes. The United Arab Emirates’ Abu Dhabi National Oil Corporation (ADNOC) 
announced a USD -45-billion downstream investment plan aiming to create the world’s largest 
refining and petrochemical facility by 2025. The company is also exploring downstream 
opportunities in India and other growing Asian markets. Such programmes are at least in part 
expla ined by the desire to create a more balanced revenue stream , including refining margins.  
Many  of the refinery projects announced include integrated petrochemical units  and the 
continued abundance  of ethane and LPG supplies may result in  expansion of more d irect 
upstream integrated projects,  bypass ing refineries.  
The direct crude oil -to-chemicals route may soon come to  challenge the current model of 
upstream integration. Saudi Aramco and SABIC have an nounced a large crude -oil-to-chemicals 
project of 40 0 thousand barrels per day  capacity, five times the size of the only similar facility  
operating now , ExxonMobil’s plant in Singapore. The Saudi project is expected to come on 
stream in the mid -2020s. Saudi Aramco is also developing a proprietary technology , bas ed on 
thermal cracking of crude oil to produce chem icals, which promises a 70 -80%  yield  of 
chemicals . A commercial design is expected to emerge by 2019. Whether such technology will 
spread to  other regions is uncertain . In oil -importing regions , the margins from direct crude -oil-
to-chemicals processes will  be lower, due to inherently higher energy requirements (relative to

 Page | 42 standard technologies) and transport costs  for the feedstock . Concurrently, Saudi Aramco  is 
also pursuing other avenues for growth  in its petrochemical operations. The company has 
announced plans to purchase a controlling stake in SABIC, one of the largest petrochemical 
companies in the world.  
Until recently, Europe was the largest producer of HVCs  globally with naphtha providing clo se 
to 75%  of this feedstock. Despite this, the combined share of gasoline and naphtha in total oil 
demand in Europe is just above one fifth, while middle distillates account for  more than half. 
Gasoline demand has decreased by a third in Europe in the last  decade, due to the switch  of 
the passenger vehicle fleet  to diesel . There is an excess of naphtha in Europe , which i s exported 
as gasoline blendstock. Historically, the largest market for it has been in the northeast of the 
United  States , but with higher refinery throughput in the United  States , the region is being 
increasingly supplied by  US refiners. Given the expected developments in supply -demand 
balances for oil products, the gasoline export market opportunities open to European refiners 
will diminish . Directing naphtha  to petrochemical operations would seem an obvio us solution;  
however , there are complex factors at p lay. 
About 40% of European naphtha steam cracking capacity is located within integrated refinery -
petrochemical complexes, with non -integr ated petrochemical companies accounting for the 
rest. Increasing integrated share even further would require new investment, either in green -
field projects or in the acquisition of assets, similar to the recently announced Saudi Aramco -
SABIC deal. Somewhat  counter -intuitively, the opposite trend has been observed in Europe.  
First, a major petrochemical enterprise, Ineos, was formed on the basis of the petrochemical 
assets that BP divested in the early 1990s. Later, Ineos purchased two BP refineries, (in th e 
United Kingdom and France), moving up the value chain. A similar transaction by 
LyondellBasell, however, was not successful, as the former Shell refinery in France purchased in 
2008 was closed in 2011, although the petrochemical units have remained in op eration. Ineos 
considered closing down refining operations at the Grangemouth site in the United Kingdom in 
2013 when margins dropped, but met strong opposition from the local employees and the 
refining operations were maintained. The company has turned to  US ethane imports to replace 
falling supplies from the North Sea, becoming the first long -haul importer of ethane in the 
world. Its two refineries and associated petrochemical plants are now operated in a joint 
venture with PetroChina, which is the intern ational arm of the China National Petroleum 
Corporation.  
Naphtha steam crackers integrated within refineries in the United  States account for less than 
20% of total US naphtha cracking capacity. Naphtha is not well placed to compete with much 
cheaper etha ne. Naphtha molecules have been traditionally redirected to the gasoline pool, 
which makes up about half of US oil product demand. US oil companies have expanded 
petrochemical operations. Half of US ethane steam crackers are now owned by oil companies 
and several new projects are in the pipeline. Despite this, there is still greater separation of 
ownership of refining and petrochemical operations in the United  States, relative to other 
regions. Chemical production still tends to take place in the vicinity o f refining operations, 
primarily on the Gulf Coast. This reflects the fact that the region is a landing point for natural 
gas and crude oil, attracting both petrochemical producers and refiners to the same region.

Key message • T he bulk of the petrochemical capacity in the United  States  is located on the Gulf Coast, 
coinciding with substantial ref ining capacity . This is because the  region is  a hotspot for both natural gas 
(NGLs for petrochemicals) and crude oil (for refineries) processing.  
In short, the regional idiosyncrasies of oil production and demand are an important factor in 
determining the  extent of integration of refining and petrochemical operations. This is especially 
true for countries that depend on imported feedstocks. In feedstock -surplus regions, gasoline 
demand can influence the attractiveness of naphtha, both positively and negati vely. Conversely, 
the availability of inexpensive feedstocks from NGL  fractionation has a significant impact on the 
feedstock choice. The role of oil companies in the petrochemical sector seems set to increase, both through operational refining/petrochemic al integration and via the more direct avenue of 
upstream/  petrochemical integration.  
A new wave of alternative feedstocks? 
A variety of carbon - and hydrogen -containing materials can replace  oil, natural gas and coal as 
chemical f eedstocks. Key among these are  bioenergy  products , which are a sou rce of both 
carbon and hydrogen. Alternatively, each element can be sourced separately, for instance from 
gases arising from the iron and steel industry ( e.g. coke oven gas  (COG)) or from CO 2 and 
water. Th e main advantage of alternative feedstocks is that they can offer a net reduction in 
CO 2 emissions  – process emissions during production and end -of-life emissions – relative to 
traditional feedstocks . The reductions stem from the fact  that these substances  would have 
otherwise gone unutilised (even if originally sourced from fossil fuels), or because they are renewable  and therefore  do not contribute to  accumulation of CO
2 in the atmosphere  (on a 
long- term basis) .

 Page | 44 Ethylene – the most important HVC  – is prod uced on an industrial scale from bioethanol 
derived from sugarcane and other bioenergy crops. So -called bioethylene is produced by 
dehydrating (removing water)  from  the ethanol in a well -established process reaction . This 
route tends to be competitive only  in areas in which bioethanol can be produced at a 
competitive cost, based on  good local availability of bio -based raw materials. Brazil,  which 
deriv es large quantities of ethanol from the  fermentation of abundant sugarcane, hosts 50% of 
the world’s bioethylene capacity . VärmlandsMetanol AB and ThyssenKrupp Industrial Solutions  
plan  to co mmission the first commercial -scale demonstration plant to produce methanol 
through biomass gasification in Sweden (VärmlandsMetanol AB, 2017) . The process will use 
similar equipment to coal -based methanol production.  
Hydrogen can be produced using water and electricity through  electrolysis , as an alternative to 
using fossil fuel feedstock s. Electrolysis is already widely deployed in industry to produce 
metals , such as aluminium and lithium. Electrolysis -derived hydrogen can be used in the 
chemical industry as a building block for all primary chemicals. Combined with nitrogen, carbon 
and ox ygen, hydrogen is used directly to produce methanol and ammonia, and indirectly (via 
methanol -to-olefins/aromatics) to produce the starting materials for the entire range of 
plastics and other chemical products. Electrolysers – the key piece of equipment r equired for 
electrolysis – operate by passing an electrical current between an anode and a cathode via an 
electrolyte. Catalysts are used to reduce the amount of electricity required.  
The largest electrolysers ever constructed operated in Norway between 1 927 and 1991, fuelled 
by low -cost and abundant hydropower (Szymanski, 2017) . The plants con sumed 
135 megawatts ( MW ) of electricity from adjacent hydropower f acilities, and each produced 
30 000 cubic metres of hydrogen per hour of operation. More recent water electrolys is 
projects for industrial- scale clean -energy applications have been much smaller, with the 
average  size of a  plant installed in 2017 being 0.75  MW (IEA, 2018) . Plans have been 
announced to build a solar -powered ammonia demonstration plant, to be commissioned in 
2019 in Australia by Yara, the world’s largest ammonia producer (Brown, 2017) . Efforts 
continue in Iowa in the  United  States  to produce  solar -ammonia for use both as a fertiliser and 
as a fuel (Schmuecker Pinehurst Farm LLC, 2017) . 
The iron and steel sector generate s several gases contain ing valuable components that make  
them suitable for use as fuels, reducing agents or even feedstock. About 20% of the methanol 
produced in China today uses COG  as feedstock, employing the same technology as coal- based 
methanol production (witho ut the gasification step). COG contains mainly hydrogen, methane, 
carbon monoxide and CO 2, and it is generated as a by -product in coke oven plants.  
There are various in itiatives to explore the use of the gases arising from  iron and steel works as 
chemical feedstock, even where the hydrogen to carbon balance is not as advantageous as in 
COG. The Carbon2Chem project in Europe aims to demonstrate ways to convert such gases  into 
ammonia and methanol, with production rates fluctuating to support electricity grid balancing 
needs (Thyssenkrupp, 2017) . Processes that biologically convert these gases  to ethanol have 
already been tested in an industria l context in China by LanzaTech  and there are further plans 
to demonstrate this technology at commercial scale in Eu rope and China (LanzaTech, 2017) . 
Although such gases often have a fossil fuel origin –  primarily coal –  their use as chemical 
feedstock c an have a positive environmental impact, relative to the use of  additional fossil fuel 
feedstock in their place.  © OECD/IEA 201 8 The Future of Petrochemicals

Key message • CO 2 utilisation and biocatalytic biomass -based processes  for the production of plastics 
have attracted most  of the investments.  
By-products and waste from other smaller industries and even from domestic food waste can 
also be used as chemical feedstock. Akzo Nobel, a European chemical producer, plans to build a 
facility in the Netherlands that will create methanol via the gasification of residual waste 
(AkzoNobel, 2018) . Similar processes exist for producing the hydrogen required for ammonia in 
Japan (Showa Denko, 2015) . 
The use of alternative feedstock is at an embryonic stage of development further downstream 
in the chemical sector. In the absence of mature industri al processes, it is instructive to look at 
the investments being made in technology start- ups as an indication of where investors see 
potential for growth in such technologies.  
During the five  years preceding 201 2, when investment in the clean technology s ector was 
buoyant, more than USD  80 million per year was invested in  alternativ e chemical feedstock start-
ups, reflecting a trend of rising investment in the biotechnology sector in general. Since the end 
of the first clean  tech nology  surge in 2011, alternative chemical feedstock start -ups, using 
biocatalytic technologies , have struggled to attract the same levels of funding. One reason for 
this is the difficulty  experienced in scaling up enzymatic conversion technologies from the 
laboratory  to the market in the short time periods that are acceptable to venture capital 
investors (usually under five years). Enzymatic processes can be highly sensitive to the precise 
condition of the feedstock and yields can be hard to replicate at scale.  
Other biomass convers ion technologies, including chemical catalysis, have received  attention in 
recent years, as have  technologies promising to convert CO 2 to chemicals. However, since 2015 
the value of the deals reported in this sector has fallen significantly, to just USD  10-20 million per 
year. Despite the promise of alternative feedstocks and the need to achieve sustainability in the 
chemical sector, the implication s are  either that investors do not think the near -term market 
opportunity is significant ( or that the market v alue will be sustained in the long- term ), or that 
there is a lack of new technologies being spun  out of laboratories into start -ups. Both trends are 
of concern  to policy  makers hoping to guide the world towards more sustainable chemical 
feedstocks and econ omic valorisation of sustainable biomass.  020406080100120

Page | 46 Bio-based plastics, especially for packaging, have attracted  the largest share of cumulative 
investments in alter native chemical feedstock start -ups over the last ten years. This likely reflects 
that there is signi ficant and growing consumer awareness of the environmental impacts of 
petroleum -based plastics . The ability to develop a complete plastic product that can be sold to 
consumer products firms without needing extensive further chemical processing or integrati on 
with other value chains  is another factor. Furthermore, plastics are a large and rapidly growing 
market  world wide that is highly differentiated by performance. The implication is that plastics 
could offer a promising route to the scale up of alternative  feedstock.  
The e nergy dr iving chemical processes 
Process energy accounts for just under half of the total energy consumed for primary chemical 
production. Process energy requirements consist of fuel, steam and electricity. The specific 
process energy demand per unit of product output (specific energy con sumption (SEC)) depends 
not only on the feedstock used but  also on local factors , such as the amount  of thermal 
integration at  the site, the age of the plant, and the operating and maintenance practices.  
The greatest gains in terms of SEC reductions result from a change in feedstock, from solid to gas 
or liquid feeds. F or coal -based ammonia or methanol, even the best- performing SEC  is around 
twice as high as the SEC related to production from natural gas. By  contrast, feedstock changes 
within  the gas or liquid range  yield  only  incremental gains in process energy performance –  the 
differential  between the best performing SEC for naphtha and for ethane steam cracking is less 
than 5%, with the latter typically r equiring t he greater a mount of process energy. 
   
Figure 2.16 • Regional SEC for ethane and naphtha steam cracking 
Note s: NA = North  America , MEA = Middle East and Africa, BPT = B est Performing Technology, and describes  the lowest specific 
energy consumption currently in commercial use.  Regional figures are average values for performance in that region.  Fuel 
requirement is shown on a  gross basis, irrespective of the fuel type and the extent of off- gas utilisation for fuel . Negative quantities 
for steam  indicate net steam production.  
Key message • Local factors can matter more than the choice of feedstock for process energy 
consumption in steam cracking.  
Local characteristics matter for process energy demand. Heat can be transferred from one gas or 
fluid  to another within a process. This enables, for example, the preheating by hot exhaust gases 
of tepid input gases , resulting  in fuel savings. The net level of steam required in a process can be 
negative, meaning that the process produces steam in excess of  its own demand , as is often the 
case with steam crackers . This excess steam can be exported to neighbo uring processes. Taking 
the dominant route  globally for producing HVCs  as an example, the performance of the average 
Asian naphtha steam cracker is only 10% higher than that of the best performing plant. In other - 5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30

cost disadvantage depends on fuel prices.   
Generally the contribution of electricity to SEC in primary c hemical production  is relatively small, 
and it tends not to vary as much between plants as the thermal components. This is because 
electrical equipment for chemical processes, such as motors, pumps and fans, tend s to be 
relatively uniform and close to maxi mum efficiency, if sized and maintained correctly .

Page | 49 Chapter 3. Chemicals and the environment  
The environmental  impact associated with  chemical products is as multi -faceted  as their role in 
society . Among other environmental ills, t he production of chemicals  lead s to carbon dioxide 
(CO 2) emissions, air pollutants and water demand . But chemical products can also fac ilitate 
environmental progress in other sectors . Any boundary drawn around the environmental impact 
of a product or industrial sector is imperfect. The key environmental constraint considered in this 
work is direct CO 2 emissions from the chemical and petro chemical sector. This, along with 
investments and fuel costs, are the key drivers of the technology selections and other results 
presented in later chapters.  
 Figure 3.1 • Scope of environmental considerations  
 
Note:  The environmental impacts indicated in the figure do  not provide an exhaustive account of the environmental burdens 
associated with the chemical sector and its products, nor does the figure  provide an account of the environmental benefits facilitated 
by chemical products, which are discussed later in this c hapter.  
Key message • Beyond CO 2 emissions, the chemical sector places a multi -faceted burden on the 
environment: air pollutants, water demand and water pollutants are key elements to consider.  
As noted earlier, chemical production, despite being the large st industrial energy consumer, is 
only the third largest source of industrial CO 2 emissions, followed by the iron and st eel, and 
cement sectors, because more than  half of its energy input is used as feedstock and leaves the 
sector locked into products. Fur ther CO 2 emissions and air pollutants are released during the use 
of certain che mical products, such as fertilis ers and cleaning products. Without effective 
management of waste and agricultural practices, plastics and fertilis ers can cause devastation to 
marine life when they leak into bodies of water. This chapter explores some key facets of these  
burden s, concentrating on CO 2 emissions, air and water pollution, and water demand.   
CO 2 emissions from the chemical sector  
Today, CO 2 emissions from the chemi cal sector are approximately 1. 5 gigatonnes of carbon 
dioxide ( GtCO 2) per year globally, or 1 8% of industrial CO 2 emissions. The sector’s emissions stem 
from two key sources. First, e nergy -related emissions (1. 3 GtCO 2 or 85%) are released , as in any 
other industrial sector, when fuel is combusted to generate heat, both directly and for the 
production of  steam on -site. Second, p rocess CO 2 emissions (0. 2 GtCO 2 or 15%) reflect the 
difference in carbon content between the feedstock and the product. For example,  if roughly 
0.4 tonnes  of methane feedstock (75% carbon) is required to make a tonne of ammonia 
(0% carbon), the process CO 2 emissions per tonne of ammonia product would be approximately

Page | 50 1.1 tonnes  of carbon dioxide ( tCO 2). Non-CO 2 greenhouse gas emissions  from the chemical sector 
are estimated to be the equivalent of a further 350 -400 million  tonnes  of carbon dioxide 
equivalent ( MtCO 2-eq) (Fischedick et al., 2014),9 but they are not further analysed in  this 
publication.  
 Figure 3.2 • Global final energy demand  and direct CO 2 emissions by sector  in 2017 
Notes:  Final energy demand for chemicals includes feedstock, and, for iron and steel, i t includes energy use in blast furnaces and coke 
ovens. Direct CO 2 emissions  include s energy and process emission s in the industry sector.  Mtoe = million  tonnes  of oil- equivalent.  
Key message • Despite being the largest industrial energy consumer, the chemical sector ranks third 
among industrial CO 2 emitters.  
Primary chemicals account for around 6 0% of the total CO 2 emissions in the chemical sector. 
Ammonia is the single largest source, contributing 49% of the primary chemicals’ CO 2 emissions, 
followed by high -value chemicals  (HVCs) (27%) and methanol (24%). The CO 2 intensity of coal -
based ammonia and methanol is , respectively, more than two and half times  and almost five 
times that based on  natural gas -based routes.  
As might be expected, t he regional shares of CO 2 emissio ns relating to primary chemical 
production follow  regional share s of production, particularly ammonia. Asia Pacific  accounts for a 
particularly large share of process emissions , due to the People’s Republic of China10 using coal as 
feedstock. The relative proportions of process and energy- related emissions in other regions are 
similar, with regions utilising lighter feedstocks ( e.g. the Middle  East) showing lower proportions 
of process emissions.   
As in other industrial sectors, CO 2 generated by the sector  has only three possible pathways : it 
can be released to the atmosphere, utilised or stored. The concept of carbon c aptur e, utilisation 
and storage (CCUS) encompasses a range of technologies and strategies for mitigating CO 2 
emissi ons. Some of the “ lowest hanging fruit” among CCUS applications are to  be found in the 
chemical sector. This is because CO 2 is separated from the process stream, in both ammonia and 
methanol production facilities , in order  to meet th e chemical process requ irements.  
The cost of CO 2 captured from concentrated process emissions from ammonia production can be 
as little as USD 2 5 (United  States dollars) /tCO 2 (Irlam, 2017) . These cheaper opportunities for CO 2 
capture from ammonia production are limited by the availability of concentrated emissions

Page | 51 streams. Some  1.7 million  tonnes of carbon dioxide per year ( MtCO 2/yr) is captured globally from 
fertiliser production facilities, beyond that utilised for urea production (Global CCS Institute, 
2018) . All of this 1. 7 MtCO 2/yr capture capacity is located in the United  States,  with the captured 
CO 2 used for enhanced oil recovery . The volume captured  is equ ivalent to 7% of the country’s 
CO 2 emissions from  producing ammonia.  
 Figure 3.3 • Direct CO 2 emissions of primary chemicals by region  in 2017 
 
Note: CSA = Central and South America . 
Key message • Regions with high levels of production, particularly of ammonia, generate correspondingly 
high levels o f CO 2 emissions.  
The po litical climate surrounding CCUS varies among  regions, particularly the “ S” – storage  – 
component . Encouraging  signs can be seen in the United States’ recent moves  to increase 
incentives for the storage  and use  of CO 2 through the so -called “45Q” legislation, which contains a 
provision to raise the tax credit for the permanent geological storage of a tonne of CO 2 from USD 22 
to USD 50 in 2026  (Bennett and Stanley, 2018) . It is estimated this could increase CO 2 capture by 
10-30 MtCO 2/yr over the next six years in the United States , with most of t he CO 2 used for 
enhanced oil recovery.  
In some parts of Europe , the outlook is less encouraging . Germany has effectively banned large -
scale storage of CO 2 gas (German Government, 2012) . The “ Speicherung von Kohlendioxid”  (CO 2 
storage act)  was signed into German law in 2012, restricting  total annual storage to 4  MtCO 2. By 
contrast, the Netherlands has ambitious plans, including funding t o store 1 8 MtCO 2 from industrial 
sources annually by 2030 (Dutch Government Parties Coalition, 2017) . This is equivalent to  one-
third of the Netherlands’ targeted industrial CO 2 emissions savings.  
The use of CO 2 for specialised purposes, such as the production o f urea and carbonated beverages  
is widespread, but these particular avenues lead to  limited – if any –  permanent reductions in CO 2 
over  the full life  cycle . As soon as th e carbonated beverage is opened  or the urea -based fertiliser is 
applied to the soil, release of the CO 2 to the atmosphere  begins again.  Additional potential 
pathways exist for the utilisation of CO 2 as a feedstock elsewhere in the chemical sector, such as 
forming the carbon content of  plastics.  
Producing a tonne of urea requires a minimum of 0.73  tCO 2. In rare cases, CO 2 is manufactured or 
sourced from naturally occurring underground deposits, but in the majority of cases it is provided 
by an adjacent ammonia plant. Nearly half of all process CO 2 generated during ammonia production 
globally (almost 130  MtCO 2/yr) is used in this way as a raw material input for urea production, with 
a further 140  MtCO 2 being released. Most CO 2 generated during ammonia production is 
combustion related, totalling nearly 300  MtCO 2. It is not so easy to capture the more dilute –  and 
therefore more expensive to separate –  CO 2 streams generated in combustion processes.  020406080100120

Key message • Nearly 13 0 MtCO 2 is utilised for urea production annually, but the bulk of this  is released 
downstream in the agriculture sector, sometimes only days later.  
CO 2 utilisation for urea production is, by a considerable margin, the largest carbon capture and 
utilisation  application globally . But it is really only a rest  stop on the road t o emissions release. 
After the urea leaves the production plant, it is sold, stored , and then applied to the soil in order 
to fulfil its primary purpose –  delivering the nitrogen it contains (46% by weight) to the roots of 
plants and crops. The CO 2 that wa s embedded in the urea i s then released to the soil and, as the

Air pollution is a public health crisis and the fourth -largest overall risk factor for human health 
worldwid e, after high blood pressure, dietary risks , and smoking (IEA, 2016a). More than eight-
out-of-ten of the world’s urban population live in areas where concentrations of air pollutants 
exceed the standards laid  out in the World Health Organiz ation’s Air Quality Guidelines (WHO, 
2005) . Energy production and use is the main contributor to air pollution, with the key  source 
being combustion of fossil fuels and biomass.  
 Box 3.1 • What is air pollution?  
Air pollution consists of  the concentrations in the air  of solids, liquids or gases  that have a negative impact on 
the surrounding environment and people. There are many such pollutants and they may occur naturally (from 
dust, wildfires and volcanoes) or as a result of human activity, be visible or invisible, emit an odour or be 
odourles s. Air pollutants can stay in the atmosphere from minutes to years , depending on their 
characteristics,  and, while often considered a local issue, may actually have a range that is local, national, 
regional or global. Primary pollutants are those emitted d irectly as a result of human activity or natural 
processes, while secondary pollutants are created by the reaction together of  primary pollutants, sunlight and 
other components of  the atmos phere.  Examples of air pollutants from human activity include:  
Sulp hur oxides (SO x), in particular sulphur  dioxide (SO 2): fossil fuels, coal and oil contain sulphur  to differing 
degrees.  If the sulphur is not removed beforehand, SO x are released at combustion and enter  the atmosphere,  
if not captured.  1.0 t ammonia

Page | 53 Nitrogen oxides (NO x), nitrogen oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2): NO x stem from high -temperature 
combustion or the oxidation of NO to NO 2 in the atmosphere. NO 2 is a toxic gas that  can lead to the formation 
of particulate matter and ozone.  
PM is a mix of solid/liquid or ganic and inorganic substances that may be a primary or secondary pollutant. PM 
can have major detrimental health impacts. Size is an important factor in determining these impacts: – 
“coarse particles” ( PM 10) are between 2.5 and 10 micrometres (µm) in diameter and “fine particles” ( PM 2.5) 
are smaller than 2.5 µm. The adverse health impacts of PM 10 are less severe than those of the fine particles.  
However, there is a longer history of data collection on PM 10 and,  even today , many cities lack the equipment 
to monitor outdoor concentrations of PM 2.5. Black carbon, a particular type of fine PM  that is formed by the 
incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and bioenergy , is a short -lived climate pollutant (SLCP).  
Carbon monoxide  is a colourless, odourless, toxic gas that comes from the incomplete combustion of fuels.  
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)  are released from chemicals, solvents or fuels (as well as natural sources) 
as they evaporate or sub limate into the surrou nding air. T hey are associated with a range of negative health 
effects. Methane, the main component of natural gas (also a SLCP), is often considered separately from other 
VOCs as its characteristics differ.  
Ammonia is released from agricultural a nd waste management activities. O nce in the atmosphere,  ammonia 
reacts with oxides of nitrogen and sulphur  to form secondary particles.  
Ground -level ozone is formed from NO x and VOCs in the presence of sunlight. At high concentrations, ozone is 
a pollutant and a SLCP.  
Other pollutants include heavy metals , such as lead ( emitted from industry, power gen eration, waste 
incineration and, in some countries,  from transport fuels ) and mercury ( mainly from coal combustion ). In line 
with previous analysis  by the International Energy Agency  (IEA) , the range  of air pollutants covered in this 
report is limited to  the anthropogenic emissions of SO 2, NO x and PM 2.5 (IEA, 2016a) .  
 
The energy sector is the largest contributor to  annual global anthropogenic emissions of three 
key air pollutants . This annual contribution is  estimated to be around 8 0 million  tonnes  (Mt) for 
SO 2, about 107  Mt for NO x and 30 Mt for PM 2.5. The main  sources of air pollutants arising from  
fuel combustion are coal ( for SO 2), oil (for NO X) and biomass ( for PM 2.5). The industrial sector is 
the largest source of SO 2 (over 45%) and NO x (26%) within the energy sector , whereas cooking 
and heat ing stoves are the largest source of PM 2.5, contributing more than  half (IEA, 2016a) .  
Among industrial activities, the chemical sector is the second largest source of SO 2 (about 
one-third ) and of NO x (almost 20 %), behi nd the iron and steel sector. It also  contribut es to PM 2.5 
(20%). Like most heavy industry, chemical sector activity tends to take place outside urban 
centres, but emissions from this activity can still have a significant impact on human health. One 
encour aging factor is that the source of emissi ons from chemical production is  stationary (unlike 
vehicles, for example) . This mean s several can be taken to mitigate emissio ns, such as installing 
specialis ed combustion and end -of-pipe capture equipment. These op tions ar e discussed further 
in Chapters 4  and 5.  
While 2.5 kilogrammes ( kg) of SO 2 and 2.0 kg of NO x are estimated to be emitted per tonne of 
primary chemical produced globally on average, just  0.2 kg of PM 2.5 is emitted on the same basis. 
Combustion -related p ollutants from primary chemical production account for almost 50% of the 
chemical sector’s NO x and around 3 0% of its  SO 2, but around just 20% of its  PM 2.5 emissions. 
Asia Pacific  suffers from substantially higher SO 2 and PM 2.5 emissions than other regions, due to 
its widespread use of coal as a source of process energy. NO x emissions do not follow a consistent 
pattern between regions , linked to the dominant fuel , as factors affecting its release tend to have 
more to do with the characteristics of the combustion equipment  used . The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8

Key message • NO x emissions from primary chemical production tend to exceed those of SO 2, apart from 
in Asia  Pacific  where coal use for chemical production takes place on a large scale.  
Water demand for primary chemicals  
Water is essential for economic act ivity, life and wellbeing . It is  also a critical input for the 
production of energy. Water is required at each stage of energy production, for fossil- fuel 
extraction, transport and processing, power production and irrigation for biofuels. Water can 
also be extracted  as a by -prod uct of fo ssil fuel extraction. Water is used in the chemical 
industry for a variety of purposes, including the cleaning and flushing of process units, steam 
generation and for use as feedstock.  
Though water is ubiquitous, freshwater makes up just 2.5% of the global  water resources, with 
less than 1% available for human consumption. The amount of water available varies by 
country and annual averages often hide the variability that occurs by season. While pockets of 
water stress11 occur in most countries,  recent estima tes indicate that more than a third of the 
global population is affected by water scarcity12 (United Nations, 2018b) . 
Population increase, economic growth and the associated rise in water demand, coupled with 
uncertainty about the impact that climate change will have on water resources , could lead  to a 
more water -constrained future. However, it is  not just quantity that impacts availability –  the 
quality of water also mat ters. While potable water is not needed for all purposes, where it is 
necessary , the water treatment processes can be costly and energy -intensive. Nonetheless , in 
areas that experience water scarcity, alternative non -fresh water sources, such as wastewater,  
brac kish water or seawater, might offer  the best option to meet growing water demand.  
Water use is commonly assessed using two measures: withdrawal and consumption. 
Withdrawal is the volume of water removed form a source , while consumption is the volume 
withdrawn that is not returned to the source (i.e.  evaporated or transported to another 
location) and is no longer available. Withdrawals are always greater than or equal to 
consumption and represent a first limit when water availability is constrained.13 Water

Page | 55 consumption reduces the amount of water available to satisfy demand and is a n important 
criterion in areas where water resources are already strained.  
Today, the agricultural sector is the largest water user, accounting for roughly 70% of water 
withdr awals and the bulk of w ater consumption. T he industrial and energy sectors together 
account for roughly 20% of global water withdrawals and around 12% of global consumption 
(IEA, 2016b) .14 Water availability15 is increasingly an important measure for assessing the 
viability of industrial and energy projects.  
The water used for primary chemicals accounts for about 1% of the water withdrawn and 4% of 
the water consumed in industry. Direct water demand estimates f or primary chemical 
production include water uses as feedstock ( e.g. steam cracking). Water demand for process 
heating is excluded due to the wide range of possible configurations for steam systems across 
chemical sites.  
In primary chemical production, wat er and energy intersect in two main ways. Most  of the 
water used is needed indirectly, for producing primary energy ( i.e. oil, gas, bioenergy) and 
generatin g the electricity that is demanded by the chemical processes. Today, about 45% of 
water withdrawn for primary chemical production is consumed, with around three -quarters in  
indirect  use. The remainder is used directly as feedstock in chemical processes such as steam 
reformers and steam crackers. As some of these processes occur at high temperature and 
pressure, high -purity freshwater is a necessity. Among primary chemicals, ammonia is the most 
water -intensive , with around 1. 3 cubic metres per tonne ( m3/t) on a global,  average , 
direct -consumption basis, followed by HVCs ( 0.8 m3/t) and methanol ( 0.6 m3/t). Water 
inten sities for each primary chemical vary regionally depending on the share of each process 
technology and fuel.   
While the risks for water -scarce regions are obvious, even regions that have ample water 
resources may face constraints related to drou ght, seasonal variation, climate change, floods, 
water pollution, and regulations. Global aggregates give some overall guidance, but assessment 
of the impact of water stress and competition between users associated with water 
withdrawals and consumption, n eeds to be location -specific.  
Asia  Pacific accounts for about half of total water withdrawals and consumption in primary 
chemical production globally. China accounts for about 80% of water withdrawals in Asia 
Pacific (primarily indirect), due to the prese nce of coal -fired power using once -through cooling 
technologies.16 While once -through cooling technologies are generally more efficient and have 
lower capital costs compared to wet -tower and dry cooling, they require the highest water 
withdrawal rate. A hig h level of coal demand for primary chemical production also contributes 
to water withdrawals, with China accounting for the bulk of global use of coal as feedstock for 
ammonia and methanol production. Coal -fired power generation (commonplace in China) that  
uses wet -tower cooling systems withdraws less water, but consumes  more relative to other 
cooling technologies.  
                                                                                 
14 Many analyses report only industrial water withdrawals and consumption, including for energy use. The IEA, which 
disaggregated this in 2016, found that the energy sector accounts for 10% of total global water withdrawals and 3% of total 
global consumption.  
15 Analysis in this report focuses on freshwater use. While non- freshwater sources are already being used, either to replace or 
complement freshwater, in many places the use of alternative sources is at a nascent stage or is not yet economic, relative t o 
freshwater.  
16 Once -through is also referred to as open loop cooling . The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8

Key message • Asia  Pacific  accounts for more than half of total water withdrawals and consumption in 
primary chemical production globally.  
Both North  America  and Europe each account for roughly 15 -20% of total global water 
withdrawals for primary chemical production and for around 10% and 15% , respectively , of 
total water consumption. N uclear  power  – which on average withdraws more water per unit of 
energy than coal or natural gas plants  – plays a greater role in electricity generation in these 
regions than in  Asia  Pacific  and the Middle  East . Direct water use per unit of primary chemical 
produced is about 30% lower in North  America  compared to Europe. This is because  Europe 
has a high  share of total ammonia production, the most direct wa ter-intensive primary 
chemical.  
While the Middle  East ’s share of global primary chemical production is similar to that of Europe 
and North  America , the region’s water withdrawals for  this activity represent only 4% globally , 
and only 8 % of water consumed . Indirect water demand for primar y chemical production in the 
Middle  East  is low relative to other regions, owing to the use of oil and gas for fuel and 
feedstock. However, it is worth noting that the sector consumes much of what it withdraws. In 
contrast, the direct use of water per tonne of primary chemical is similar to that in North  America because  a similar range  of primary chemicals is produced. This, in combination 
with relatively low indirect consumption, leads to a greater share of direct water use in  total 
consumption than in mos t other regions.  
The majority of the primary chemical production  capacity in the Middle  East  is located on the 
coastline of the Persian Gulf, to facilitate trade. Unfortunately, this area includes  some of the 
most water -stressed countries in this part of the world, including Kuwait, Saudi  Arabia, Qatar 
and United Arab Emirates, where  water scarcity is already a major concern. Rising demand for 
water for increased primary chemical prod uction may cause the region to rely more on costly 
and energy -intensive forms of wate r supply such as desalination.  0150300450600750

Environmental impacts of chemical products  
Chemical products are one of the key materials used in a multitude of end -use sec tors. A “late 
bloomer ” among industrial sectors, the chemical sector has increased its market size by 
producing substitut es for  other materials such as wood and metals . As discussed in Chapter 1, 
these are  now the first choice s among materials for many end- use applications . Consumer goods 
and packaging materials rely extensively on  plastics, but plastics are also making inroads into the 
sectors traditionally dominated by other materials, such as building s and transport, par tly The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8 
Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers  
 Page | 58 because of increasing attention paid  to energy savings and emissions reduction in these sectors. 
Conversely, chemical sector outputs can also be deployed to make inefficient or wasteful devices 
and products , leading  to emissions in other sectors. They can  even become  pollutants 
themselves . 
Chemical products can help reduce  emissions  in other sectors  
Improving the thermal performance of buildings , using efficient construction practices , and 
renovations targeted at impro ving energy efficiency  have  the potential to save the equivalent of 
the annual energy usage of all the Group of 20 major world countries in 2015 (UNEP and IEA, 
2017) . Enhanced insulation materials are required to capture this energy saving potential. 
Because of their enhanced engineering properties, synthetic insulation materials (most of which 
are plastic -based) make up  90-95% of all thermal insulation material produ ction (Bozsaky, 2011) . 
For example, the thermal resistance  of polyurethane is among the highest in its class of insulation 
materials . Low-pressure expandable foams can also significantly reduce air leakages and thermal 
bridges (i.e.  paths for heat transfer within  the building en velope) . Reflective roof coatings , made 
of plastics , are known to help cool buildings in warmer  climates .  
However, using chemical -based insulating materials has  broader environmental impacts. For 
instance, the embodied CO 2 (the emissions released during i ts manufacture) of  polyurethane and 
polystyrene is higher than that in  naturally occurring insulation materials, and they are also more 
difficult to recycle. The  buildings and construction sector  is the second -largest user of plastics 
after packaging . This  sector  needs to seize the opportunities for energy efficiency that are offered 
by chemical -based products while also considering potential externalities, especially at the 
production and end -of-life phases.  A key enabling action is to provide better infor mation to 
designers and specifiers during the design process . 
The material mix of vehicles in the transport sector is dominated by conventional steel alloys . 
However, the ever -growing pressure for fuel efficiency improvement and the rapid uptake of 
electric vehicles are gradually changing the picture. At present, fuel efficiency policies cover 80% 
of global passenger car sales and 50% of global truck sales, and the coverage  (and stringency) of 
efficiency regulations seem s set to increase.  
The use of lightweight materials –  plastic -based materials, as well as other materials , such as hi gh 
strength steel and aluminium –  is an important pathway  to a significant improvement in the fuel 
efficiency  of vehicles. The trend is already visible. I n the United  States  over the period 1995 -2014 , 
the share of p lastics, plastic composites , and rubber in the material composition of light -duty 
vehicles has grown on average from 10.5% to 13.2%  (Dai, Kelly and Elgowainy, 2016) .  
Resins that are reinforced with carbon fibre are one of the most common plastic -based materials 
used in lightweight vehicle design, but , on an industrial scale , recycling options for this material 
remain elusive, mainly because of the tendency to damage the fibres during the recycling 
process. Moreover, s ome characteristics of recycled carbon fibres are not well controlled, 
including their origin , which diminishes confidence in the performance of recycled carbon fibre 
material. This means the recycling of plast ic composites is typically open loop, because  recycled  
carbon  fibres cannot be used again for the same application (Oliveux, Dandy and Leeke, 2015) . 
The s hare of lighter materials in vehicles is  likely to continue to increase, as countries introduce 
specific targets for light -weighting. For example, based on a 2010 baseline the United  States  has 
set targets for reducing vehicle weight by  30% and 50% by 2025 and 2050 , respectively (US DOE, 
2013) . The growing adoption of electric vehicles, where the challeng e of weight reduction  to 
increase driving range is acute, c ould  also translate into greater  use of  plastic and plastic -based 
composites . The widespread deployment of autonomous, connected, electric and shared vehicles 
could also increase the potential for the use of plastics in cars, if confidence in the prospect of © OECD/IEA 201 8 The Future of Petrochemicals  
 Towards more s ustainable plastics and fertilis ers 
    
Page | 59 fewer and less -severe accidents in such vehicles extend s the reach of plastics into a core 
structural role.  Such a development could  challenge conventional notion s of automotive design, 
for example, the use of  steel for frames and panels.  
Chemical products can also play  a role in the  next round of cost reductions in ren ewable energy 
generation. For example, in the wind energy sector, light -weight plastic -based materials can help 
address the challenges of making longer turbine blades, thereby increasing  generation efficie ncy. 
Innovative materials  can also help  increas e the durability of wind turbines, thus reducing the cost 
of maintenance. This is especially beneficial in harsh environments, such as those offshore.  
Indirect emissions associated with chemical products  
Desp ite their benefits , chemical products also come with environmental burdens. For example, 
chemical products are now one of the main sources of VOC  emissio ns. While such  emissions from 
vehicles have increasingly come under scrutiny by regulators in recent years, less attention has 
been paid to emissions from chemical products. Recent research suggests that chemical products 
such as adhesives, paints and pesticides now riv al vehicle emissions as the top source of urban air 
pollution (McDonald et al., 2018) . This underlin es the need for  a careful assessment of the net 
emissions impacts of material selection .  
Although chemical products can contribute to GHG emissions mitigation in other sectors, they 
also generate such emissions,  both upstream and downstream. As discussed earlier in the 
chapter, t he largest source of such (indirect) CO 2 emissions upstream  is the provision of the 
energy demand of the sector. For instance, global CO 2 emissions from the electricity  consumed in 
the chemical sector are estimated at around 110 MtCO 2, which is e quivalent to 8 % of the direct 
CO 2 emissions from chemicals production. Downstream, agriculture and waste management  are 
the two sectors that generate most of the GHG emissions related to chemical products.  
When nitrogen fertilisers are applied , they undergo chemical reactions with air and the water in 
soils during the process of delivering their nutrients to plants. These reactions emit nitrous oxide 
(N2O) as a by-product to the atmosphere , a powerful GHG  that is 2 65 times as strong as CO 2. 
Emis sions of N 2O from synthetic fertilisers are estimated to be 2. 3 Mt of N2O per year. This is  the 
equivalent of 61 0 MtCO 2, or about 40% of the direct chemical sector CO 2 emissions (FAOSTAT, 
2018) . Urea –  the largest volume nitrogen fertiliser – contribut es more than half of these N 2O 
emissions as well as  releases the CO 2 that was embedded within it during manufacture. CO 2 
emissions from urea decomposition are estimated at around 13 0 MtCO 2/yr, equivalent to about  
9% of direct CO 2 emissions from the chemical sector. The oxidation of solvents, surfactants, 
explosives and fuel additives during use are other sources of downstream GHG emissions. These 
use-phase emissions  quantities are uncertain, but, in any case, are likely to be dwarfed by the 
agriculture sector emissions (Neelis et al., 2005) . 
Environmental impacts  of product disposal  
There are several environmental problems associated with the improper disposal and 
management of plastics, particularly after they enter waste streams. Aside from recycling 
(discussed previously) , there are two other  options  for dealing with plastic waste: incineration 
and landfilling. Both tend to be much cheaper than recycling, mainly because the plastic s need 
not be separated from the ot her components of solid municipal waste streams. Cost is not the 
only concern. Waste incinerat ors can cause local air pollution, if not properly designed and 
maintained. Landfills can lead to water pollution, air pollution, GHG  emissions ( e.g. methane ). 
They are also an eyesore.

 Page | 60  Box 3.2 • Distinguishing b io-based, b iodegradable , and compostable plastics  
“Biodegradable ” plastics and “bio-based ” plastics  are often confused becaus e they both include the prefix 
“bio”. Bio -based plast ics are by definition  those made from biomass sources, such as corn and maize, whereas 
biodegradable plastics are not necessarily made from biomass feedstock. “Bioplastics” is a broad term used to 
refer to both of these plastic categories individually, or collectively.  
Biodegr adability is the property that enables a material to be broken down into water, CO 2, methane,  and 
some other materials in a reasonable time  frame. This work is carried out by microorganisms, which require 
certain  conditions of  light, temperature and humidity . In practice, a large portion of biodegradable plastic is 
made fr om traditional petrochemicals, in some cases with the biodegradable property enhanced by the use of 
additives.

Biodegradable plastics are also different from compostable plastics. B iodegradability is but one of the many 
properties required for a material to be  compostable. For c ompostable plastics,  the pace of degradation must 
be consistent with known compostable materials ( e.g. cellulose) , and the process should not generate a ny 
toxic residue. The European Union  considers a material compostable only if  over 90% o f the origi nal material 
can be broken down by biological processes within six months.  
Biodegradability can be a useful f eature in certain circumstances. However,  the environmental benefits of 
biodegradable plastics are much -debated. When landfilled, or if they make t heir way into the ocean, they 
often do not degrade as  advertise d, as the necessary environmental conditions are not met. Even with 
favourable conditions, it can take years for these materials to degrade. As these plastics are not recyclable, 
they can compr omise the quality of collected scrap materials when mixed in recycling bins, thus undermining 
the efficiency of recycling processes.  
Furthermore, they can  give a false sense that there is no problem in throwing away these plastics. When  
littered,  there is a high  chance of the degraded fragments being consumed by animals . It could be argue d that 
the biodegradable quality  expedites  emission  of the carbon contained in the material . Biodegradability does 
not offset the damage caused by irresponsible l ittering or the inadequate management of plastic waste.

Page | 61 Incineration of plastic waste can be carried out with or without energy recovery. The former 
requires more capital investment, but has the advantage of providing an energy source from 
waste. With or  without energy recovery, in order to prevent pollution , sophisticated 
combustion and cleaning equipment, such as low -NO x burners an d flue -gas scrubbers, is 
needed to remove the toxic components of the exhaust gas to prevent local pollution.  
Incineration of plastic waste without energy recovery should generally be avoided, but it 
persists today as an attractive option in jurisdictions that are land - and cost - constrained . This 
is because the plastic portions of waste are highly calorific, with  many resins containing a n 
amount of embedded energy that is similar to that of crude oil, per unit of mass . Burning waste 
reduces its volume by roughly 90%, which reduces the amount of land that is required for 
landfill sites. But, unconstrained, t his app roach to incineration results in CO 2 emissions while 
wasting a potential source of energy.  
Leaving aside  incineration without energy recovery, landfill is the least favourable option for 
managing plastic waste. Landfill leads to multiple sources of polluti on, especially when poorly 
managed. It is estima ted that 11% of global methane emissions stem from landfill sites (Global 
Methane Initiative, 2011) . Landfill sites also cont aminate water supplies and create significant  
health and safety hazards for nearby inhabitants.  
Sorting both domestic and imported waste is a source of income in some developing 
economies, but working conditions tend to be insalubrious and unsafe  in these mainly 
“informal sectors” of the waste management economy. Plastics are often “burned on the go” in 
the pursuit of more valuable materials, such as the gold and rare earth metals found in small 
quantities in waste electronic equipment. In areas with substantial stockpiles of such 
equipment and other valuable waste streams, “landfill mining” has emerged as a formal source 
of multiple scarce and valuable resources. Like its informal counterpart, landfill mining 
presents significant health and enviro nmental risks if not conducted properly. Furthermore, 
plastics are of relatively little value, highly mixed and difficult to extract.  
Compared with other materials, t he low recycling rate for plastics  (post -consumer collection 
rates for recycling),  diminishes the environmental case for the increased use of chemical 
products in other sectors. Less than 20% of plastic waste is collected for recycling, whereas the 
rates for steel and paper amount to around 80% and 60%, respectively. This suggests that 
proper management of plastic waste and strengthened efforts to improve recycling are a 
crucial prerequisite to the claim that using them as substitutes has a positive impact  on the 
environment  overall.  
Progress has been made in this direction in certain re gions. In Europe, plastic recycling and 
energy recovery from plastic waste have both steadily increased by 6% annually during the past 
decade, and in 2016, recycling overtook landfilling as a destination for plastic waste for the first 
time. Korea and Japan achieved this feat several years earlier, with landfill rates in each 
country being in single digits.  The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8

Key message •  Plastic recycling overtook landfilling for the first time in Europe in 2016.  
During disposal and recycling, enzymatic and other innovative chemical pathways can be 
deployed to decompose or degrade plastic waste.  Mobilising these reactions requires capital-
intensive process equipment  and substantial quantities of energy , and it often incurs a significant 
yield loss. However, p romisin g advances are taking place. In 2016, researchers identified a 
naturally occurring enzyme that evolve d in Japanese landfills to “eat”  polyethylene terephthalate 
(PET) plastic – now appropriately named “ PETase ” (Yoshida et al., 2016) . In 2018 it was 
discovered accidentally that breaking down the PET plastic into manageable chunks  increased  the 
rate at which the enzyme can consume the PET (University of Portsmouth, 2018) . This and similar 
innovations hold out a prospect of making chemical recycling competitive with virgin plastic 
production in the future,  thus reducing costs and the consumption of energy and natural 
resources.  
Plastic waste trade  
Regional variation s in waste management policy, including landfill, and the differing amounts of 
solid municipal waste produced by different economies have contribute d to the phenomenon of 
waste being traded and shipped around the world. Trade in plastic waste peaked in 2014 at 
almost 1 6 Mt globally, th e equivalent of nearly 5% of global plastic production in the same year. 
Global trade in  plastic waste has since declined. A sharp decrease took place in 2017 , when global 
traded volumes almost halved , compared to the previous year.  
China receives around h alf of the plastic waste exported globally,  with  volumes  amounting to  
7 Mt in 2016 and 4  Mt in 2017. Asian countries supply around 40% of these quantities, with 
Europe and North  America  each supplying approximately a further 30 % (United Nations, 2018a) . 
In a radical recent shift in policy , as of  1 January  2018, Chin a severely limited the impo rt of post -
consumer plastic waste  from other countries. It intends to  ban the practice c ompletely  in 2019. 
Recently compiled data on trade suggest plastic waste exports to China already decreased by 
roughly 40% in 2017,  compared to the previous year. This policy development will put pressure 
on waste -exporting countries to implement measur es that reduce waste generation  and to 
develop adequate domestic infrastructure to manage the waste that is generated . 0%20%40%60%80%100%

Key message •  Plastic waste exports to China plummeted by roughly 40% during 2016/ 2017.  
Water pollutants  
There are many ways that  chemical products  enter waterways , including agricultural run -off, 
domestic and commercial wastew ater containing cleaning and sanitary products, and leakage 
from landfills and disposal sites. Chemical products can be dissolved in these streams, float on 
top, or be dispersed on river or ocean floor s. Two important examples , related to the largest 
synth etic chemical product f amilies explored in this report  (i.e. fertilisers and plastic), are plastic 
waste leakage and the contribution of fertilisers and detergents to eutrophication , whereby a 
surge in algae growth deprives all other life of oxygen, leadin g to suffocation.  
Plastic pollution in the world’s oceans has gained  much attention in recent years.  Plastics make 
their way into water courses in a variety of ways. One example is the p lastic micro -beads , used in 
cosmetics and personal care products , whic h are flushed into the sewer system during and after 
use, thereby eventually ending up in waterways. Another is synthetic microfibres, which are shed 
from clothing during washing.  
Unfortunately, t he quantities and sources of plastic waste leaking into the oceans are particularly 
difficult to measure and identify. While the numbers are approximations , it has been  estimated 
that the quantity of land -based plastic entering the ocean in 2010 was  5-13 Mt (Jambeck et al., 
2015) . In the absence of substantive remedial action, the lea kage rate is likely to have increased 
in line with the strong growth in plastic demand/disposal.  
It is estimated that 80% of the plastic in the ocean derives  from land -based sources, as opposed 
to fisheries and ships, and that , of this portion, more than half can be attributed to five countries: 
China, Indonesia, Philippines , Thailand , and Viet  Nam (Ocean Conservancy, 2015) . Around 
three- quarters of the plastic leakage in the oceans  that originates on land has never been 
collected as waste;  but the other quarter leaks from w ithin waste  management systems.  
When plastic waste finds its way into the ocean, ultraviolet radiation from the sun breaks it down 
into small pieces, reaching microplastic status at five millimeters or less in size (NOAA, 2014). 
Microplastics are commonly mistaken for plankton and are ingested by marine life, leading to 
choking and starvation. As the mass of larger debris –  including containers, bottle caps, crates  
and old fishing gear –  continues to degrade over time, the qua ntity of microplastics could 
increase 30 -fold. The most common type of plastic waste found in marine debris is polyethylene 0369121518

in bottle caps, food wrappers  and food containers ) (NOAA, 2014).  
In the Pacific Ocean, currents have concentrated a substantial portion of this plastic into what 
has become known as the “Great Pacific garbage p atch ” or “Pacific trash vortex ” (NOAA, 2017a). 
The name may suggest a large island of visible waste floating on  the surface of the ocean. 
However , much of the debris comp rises  microplas tics that are distributed throughout the water 
column and are not immediately visible to the naked eye.

Key message •  The largest among the Pacific Ocean garbage patches is estimated to measure 1 .6 million 
square kilometres  (km2), approximately equivalent to  three times the size of France.  
Various estimates of the siz e of the Pacific garbage patch  have been made, the largest of  which is 
1.6 million  km2, or three times the size of France (Lebreton et al., 2018) . The quantity of plastic 
has been estimated at 1. 8 trillion plastic pieces, weighing some  79 kt. Th is is the  equivalent to 
250 pieces of plastic for each person in the world and the weight of 500 jumbo jets.  
However, since there is not a s ingle continuous patch of waste  and, since ocean currents and 
winds are continuously mixing, moving and changing th e concentration of the debris , it is difficult  
to assess the exact size, mass  and location of the “patch” or “patches” (NOAA, 2017b) . 
Agricultural run -off containing excess fertilisers is changing aquatic ecosystems around the world 
through a process called eutrophication. Eutrophication occurs when an excess of nutrients 
enters a body of water, leading to large increases in the growth of plant organisms such as 
phytoplankton, more com monly known as algae. When the phytoplankton die, bacterial 
decomposition of the dead phytoplankton depletes oxygen levels in the water. This creates a 
low-oxygen environment that is inhospitable to animal life and results in “dead zones ”.

3.2 million km2 catchment area – the third -largest in the world –  into the Gulf. The river carries  
with it nitrogen and phosphorous nutrients from  the fertilisers applied to farmland across the 
central United  States  and from as far north as Saskatchewan, Canada (National Park Service, 
2017) . Other nutrient sources, including animal manure, human waste , and industrial waste also 
contribute to nutrient enrichment.  
In the autumn, winds from seasonal storms mix the oxygen -depleted deep water with oxygen -
rich surface water, clearing the dead zone until the next run -off th e following spring. In 2017, the 
dead zone reached its la rgest size ever recorded: at 22  700 km2, it covered an area approximately

Part B : Two contra sting  future s for  petrochemicals  
Any number of possible futures exist for petrochemicals, and to forecast a specific future would 
be both unhelpful and fool -hardy . Yet future opportunities must be identified and constraints 
addressed. Scenario analysis offers a constructive way forward. Specifying the probable 
outcomes of the forward projection of carefully selected baseline assumptions can help to 
identify the polic y interventions that  may be required along the way , to shape an acceptable 
future.  
The purpose of Part B  of this publication is to explore two contrasting futures for the chemical 
sector. The first is shaped by the projection of the current trajectory, sh aped by existing and 
announced policies  (Chapter 4) . The second is rather different. It stipulates up -front a more 
sustainable end-point and examines the course by which it might be realised  (Chapter 5) . The 
final chapter focuses on the policy areas and in struments which need most attention if a 
sustainable future for the chemical industry is to be attained  (Chapter 6) .

Page | 69 Chapter 4. What  is the  current trajectory  for petrochemicals ? 
This chapter concentrates on drawing a plausible picture of the implication s for energy and the 
environment of persistence into the future of current trends in the economy. This is done using 
the Reference Technology Scenario  (RTS) (see Box 4.1). The chapter  explores  technological 
progress and innovation, feedstock availability, demand and several other important factors in 
the chemical industry .  
On this basis, o f the nearly 10  million barrels per day ( mb/d ) growth in total  oil demand projected 
for 2030, the chemical sector is on course to account for more than a third . This share climbs to 
nearly  50% in 2050 ( or almost 7  mb/d), compensating for slower growth or decline elsewhere. 
The sector also plays a significant role in global growth in gas demand, acc ounting for 7 % of the 
roughly 850  billion cubic metres (bcm) increas e between 201 7 and 2030 , and 4% of the increase 
projected for 2050. Consequently , direct carbon dioxide ( CO 2) emissions from the sector increase 
by around  30% between 201 7 and 2050.  
Growing demand for chemicals  in the RTS  
On the  current trajectory, demand  for primary chemicals is set to increase by around 30 % by 
2030 and almost 60% by 2050. At this rate of growth, the sector’s output of primary chemicals  
will exceed  1 billion  tonnes  (Bt) in 2050, reaching the same order of magnitude as that of cement 
and crude steel.   
Production of  methanol  in the RTS is the highest area of global growth among primary chemicals,  
with output  increasing by more than 50% by 2030 and almost doubling by 2050. Asia  Pacific  is 
responsible for nearly two -thirds  of this growth, more than 6 0% of which occurs by 20 30. The 
People’s Republic of China17 was already responsible for more than 50% of global methanol 
production in 201 7, a figure that  remains relatively consistent throughout the period to 2050. 
Although it accounts for a re latively small share throughout, North America is the region with the 
fastest rate of growth ; by 2050, its  methanol production  nearly  triples . Africa and Eurasia see 
similarly strong growth trajectories, again starting from a small share.  
 Box 4.1 • The RTS 
The RTS is a modelled projection of what might take place in the chemical sector  between now and 2050. The 
modelling is based on cost -optimal decisions on  the equipment and operation of the industry . It occurs within 
an energy price and chemical demand context  informed by the range of existing and announced policies and 
by established behavioural and other exogenous considerations.  
The assumptions made about the future of the wider energy system are broadly in line with those of the 
International Energy Agency’s (IEA)  New Policies Scenario , featured in the World Energy Outlook  (IEA, 2017) . 
That scenario  aims to provide a sense of where today’s policy intentions seem likely to take the energy sector. 
It incorporates the policies and measures that governments around the world have already put in place, and  
the effects of announced policies, as expressed in official targets or plans.  
The RTS is the baseline scenario used for this modelling, but it and the projections made ther ein are not 
forecasts. W hereas the IEA makes short -term forecasts for certain fuels and technologies, it does not make 
long -term forecasts. The modelling horizon ( 2050)  and approach ( constrained cost optimisation of 
technologies that are, at least, at the demonstration stage or beyond) in this publication are two important  
factors that make the results unsuitable to  use as a forecast.

 Page | 70 Technologies and po licies can change rapidly, without much forewarning , and in 2050 , there are likely to be 
new technologies available, the pre cursors of which have yet to be conceived in a laboratory. Prices for many 
fuels, such as oil and gas, tend to move in cycles,  rather than follow cons istent  trends, and the markets in 
which they are traded remain  out of equil ibrium for extended periods. By contrast, the modelling 
underpinning  this publication and that of the wider energy system informed by the World Energy Outlook , 
achieve equilibrium in these markets in  the long -term. Despite these reservations,  the approach adopted 
offers important insights into a range of possible futures for the chemical sector . The insights suggest where 
the best opportunities lie and what form of intervention might most profitably be addressed by policy  makers.  
 
The underlying reasons fo r the high growth rates projected for methanol, especially in the 
short term, relate to two relat ively new applications: its use  as a fuel additive and its use as an 
intermediate for producing high -value chemicals  (HVCs) . Fuel -related applications of methanol, 
which currently account for about 35 -40% of demand, are motivated by their capacity to 
reduce local air pollutants and improve the combustion performance of various fuels, both of 
which are likely to remain important in the future. Methanol’s high oct ane number means it 
can be highly compressed before igniting, raising the power generated on ignition. Methanol 
can be blended directly with, and substitute for, varying quantities of hydrocarbon fuels, such 
as gasoline and bunker fuel, depending on the ap plication. It can also remain in the chemical 
and refining sectors, undergoing further transformation into intermediates, such as methyl 
tert- butyl ether, which can be blended into gasoline, or dimethyl ether, which can be blended 
into liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG).  
Methanol’s use as an intermediate for producing other primary chemicals, via the methanol- to-
olefins (MTO) and methanol to aromatics (MTA) processes, is another important application. 
Whereas MTA is still at the demonstration phase, MTO is comm ercial and currently accounts 
for around 21% of global methanol production, all the capacity for which is in China. By 2020, 
the MTO -bound component of output almost doubles, contributing nearly half the global 
growth in methanol demand over this period.  
Demand for HVCs  grows by around 60% by 2050  (relative to 2017 ), the second -fastest rate 
among primary chemicals. About 55% of this growth materialises by 2030. Asia  Pacific  is the 
world’s leading HVC -producing region by far in both 201 7 and 2050 . It increa ses its production 
levels  by more than two -thirds  during this period, its global share of HVC  production rises from 
48% to 5 1% by 2050. While Asia Pacific grows most in absolute terms, the Middle East and 
Africa are the fastest growing regions in the long run. Africa triples its production volume and 
the Middle East more than doubles it by 2050. North, Central and South America all grow at 
slower rates, but still reach nearly 1 15 million  tonnes  (Mt) of combined HVC production in 
2050.  
In the short term, plastics are expected to remain the key driver of demand for HVCs . The 
largest derivatives of ethylene and propylene are polyethylene and polypropylene respectively, 
each of which account s for nearly two -thirds of the demand for their pa rent chemicals. 
Benzene, toluene and mixed xylenes (BTX) continue to have a broader set of downstream 
applications . Even so, approximately half is  destined for plastic and other durable material 
uses.

 Page | 72 As various regions grow both in population and in levels of wealth, plastic consumptio n is 
expected to show a robust rate of increase in the RTS, particularly for packaging and 
construction. Production volumes for a group of key thermoplastics (including polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET), high -density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), low -density 
polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS)) grow from approximately 3 50 Mt 
in 2017, to 5590 Mt in 2050, an increase of nearly  70%.18 This represents a global per capita 
production increase of nearly 3 0%, with global aver age per capita production of these plastics 
increasing from around 4 7 kilogrammes per capita (kg/capita) in 2017 to more than 6 0 kg/capita 
in 2050.  
The more than factor of 2 discrepancy between the per capita and absolute production increases 
is due to the plateauing  of plastic consumption observed in several mature economies today , 
such as Europe and Japan . Although high quality, granular data on this sector are s carce, per 
capita consumption even appears to be declining slightly in some advanced economies. 
Widespread concerns about the environmental impacts associated with single -use plastics cast 
some doubt over the growth prospects for particular demand segments , but the majority of the 
current end uses for plastic –  not to mention as -yet unforeseen applications –  seem less likely to 
be subject to such concerns , especially in developing economies .

Key message • Production of key thermoplastics grows by nearly  70% in the RTS between 201 7 and 2050, 
with global average per  capita  demand increasing  by just under 30%. 
Virgin plastic production requires inputs of HVCs, but recycling using pla stic scrap does not. 
Plastic recycling rates have been increasing rapidly in Europe over the past two decades, and 
this trend continues in the RTS. Collection rates for recyclable plastic waste double in Europe,

Page | 73 reaching near their maximum practical limit for most resins by 2050. However, without firm 
commitments to move to secondary production routes in developing economies, this 
considerable, but localised, recycling effort results in less than 20%  of recyclable plastic waste 
being collected globally by 2050, in the RTS.  
Ammonia  grows at the slowest rate among primary chemicals, but its growth is evenly 
distributed over the period to 2050. An increase of more than 15 % by 2030 and by more than 
30% by  2050 is registered globally. In general, developed economies cede ground to developing 
economies in terms of shares of global ammonia production . The strongest regional growth rates 
for ammonia production occur  in Africa and the Middle  East . Africa nearly  doubles  its production, 
although it still provides less than 5 % of global production in 2050. The Middle  East  almost 
doubles its ammonia production volume by 2050.  
Ammonia is, and remains , a product less regionally concentrated than HVCs  and methanol, 
perhaps because its importance was well established before globalisation. While the Asia  Pacific  
region remains the dominant regional production centre throughout the RTS, its share of global 
production declines slightly, dropping below 50% in 2050.  
Historic ally, ammonia production has been driven primarily by demand for nitrogen fertilisers. 
This continues to be the case in the RTS, but with significant saturation taking hold in developed 
economies. A decline in the absolute level of production even begins t o appear  in certain 
established production centres, such as Europe. Demand in developing economies, and 
indigenou s production in those regions , continues to be governed  by agriculture , but even this 
growth is tempered by increased efficiencies in fertilise r application over time.  
In industrial uses , both ammonia and its largest volume derivative , urea , continue to be  sources 
of growth in the short to medium term. Despite its predominant use as a fertiliser, urea has a 
small but expanding portfolio of non -agricultural uses, including AdBlue, which is used to reduce 
air pollutants from diesel engines. Important industrial applications  include explosives used  in the 
demolition and mining industries, and various synthetic materials , such as nylon, acrylic fibres 
and nitrile rubber. These non -fertiliser uses of ammonia currently account for about 10 -20% of 
global demand . Their increased growth does not fully compensate for the slow -down in 
agricultural uses, which contribut es to the p lateauing of global demand towards 2050.  
On the supply side, c urrent capacity and utilis ation levels, along with the volume of capacity 
under construction or likely to be deployed, inform our short -term projections , and a range of 
macro -economic trends sha pe the  medium -long term (post- 2025) projections. Datasets on 
population and GDP – along with observations of the levels of wealth at which demand for 
various products tends to  become  saturate d – are used to derive the growth in consumption. The 
patterns of  trade between regions and the shares of propylene and BTX aromatics sourced from 
the refining sector are assumed to evolve in line with current trends.19 
Plastic recycling in the RTS  
Increased efficiency in the  use of materials is another factor expected t o affect the supply and 
demand of primary chemicals. Growth in plastic recycling reduce s primary chemical demand –  
particularly for HVCs  – by reducing the tonnages of virgin plastics , relative to plastics produced 
from scrap. There are three main factors in recycling when targeting primary chemical savings: 
the collection rate, the yield rate and the displacement rate.

Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers  
 Page | 74 The most familiar of these is the collection rate, which describes the proportion of plastic waste 
that is collected for recycling , relativ e to the quantity of recyclable plastic waste available.20 The 
recycling yield rate accounts for the material losses incurred during the pre-processing and 
recycling processes. The displacement rate refers to the amounts of plastic resins and products 
that, when recycled, are re manufactured in to forms that either fulfil their original purpose or do 
not prevent the material from being recycled again , or both. When these requirements are not 
met, the result is down -cycling. A  real- life example of down -cycling is provided in Chapter 1 
(Box 1.3), which describes how  PET bottles are recycled to produce PET fibre, for which there is 
currently no commercial recycling route available.   
These three factors – the collection, recycling yield and displacement rates –  are multiplicative, 
meaning that improvements are needed across the board to effect significant reduction s in virgin 
primary chemical demand.  
Not all plastics are equal, either , in terms  of their recycling potential or in terms of the impact 
their recycling h as on primary chemical demand. Consider two contrasting examples,  PET and 
PVC:   
• PET resin (excluding polyester fibre) is almost exclusively used for packaging, much of which is 
single -use and therefore short- lived. PET is made from purified tereph thalic ac id and ethylene 
glycol. The terephthalic acid is  derived from para- xylene (part of the BTX aromatics) and 
ethylene glycol is derived  from ethylene. One unit of PET requires approximately 0. 6 units of 
BTX aromatics and 0. 2 units of ethylene, in mass terms.21 
• One unit of PVC22 requires twice as much ethylene, but less than 0. 1 units of BTX aromatics 
and a further 0. 1 units of propylene. The largest use of PVC is in construction. PVC windows, 
pipes and doors tend to stay locked in  the built e nvironment for 20 ye ars or more . Even when  
they become available, they are hard  to extract from the other building materials that 
accompany them.  
Recycling 1 unit of PET result s in 38% more primar y chemical savings than for PVC. T here are also 
more abundant stocks available to recycle as newer  (and therefore larger) vo lumes of packaging 
material are readily available.  The PVC incurs a substantial delay before it is available for 
recycling.  
Establishing an expectation of future rates of recycling  is complex. It depends on a variety of 
factors, including: which recycling technologies will reach maturity, what levels of government 
support will be maintained or realised in various regions, how the relative costs of virgin plastic 
production evolve, a nd consumer behaviour, among other considerations. The RTS assumes that 
collection rates increase only marginally across most regions, with much stronger increases 
taking place in those regions already more committed to action towards sustainable plastic w aste 
management . Europe, Japan and Korea are leading the way in this.   
In the RTS, a verage rates of collection for the main thermoplastics increase  by around  25% above 
today’s relatively low levels  by 2050,  with the average rate in Europe –  already high in  global 
terms – nearly doubling. Current levels of recycling yield are estimated to be 70 -82%, and the 
displacement rate  to be 32-37%. Yield and displacement rates are resin -specific rather than 
geography -specific, and the  improvements to these rates  in th e RTS globally are incremental.  
                                                                                 
20 As plastics typically remain in use for between a day and half a century, existing plastic waste and plastic production differ 
at a given point in time.

Key message • Plastics differ in both their composition and use profile.  
The relatively  modest increases in collection rates in most regions means the global average 
collection rate remains at less than 60%  of that seen in Europe today . This i s explained by the 
changing regional shares of global plastic consumption and waste. Developing economi es sharply 
increase their share  of global plastic consumption , whereas the share of developed countries –  in 
which the highest rates of recycling take pl ace – shows no increase  or, in many cases , decline s. 
For example, E urope’s share of global plastic consumption declines b y approximately 40% 
between 2017  and 2050, whereas India’s more than doubles . This dynamic, combined with the 
minimal increases in yield and displacement rates, means plastic recycling has  a limited impact in 
the RTS, despite the significant efforts deployed in certain regions.   
Feedstock s in the RTS: N o radical change  
Feedstock c hoices in the RTS  are based  mainly  on cost, and the trend is to continuity of choice  in 
each region. Towards the end of the period assessed, the CO 2 emission s reduction commitments 
of certain countries – those  that already have a strong policy or legal bac king – start to take hold , 
but have a limited impact on feedstock choice . Existing carbon capture, utilisation and storage 
(CCUS ) projects persist, and the few that have been announced (but not built) come to fruition. In 
some cases,  a modest switch to som e alternative feedstocks  takes place . These ar e oddities 
rather than the norm. They are overshadowed by enormous growth in the consumption of 
traditional feedstock s.  
Oil feedstock demand for p rimary chemicals increases by 30 % by 2030 and then undergoes a 
further increase of 2 5% by 2050, driven by robust demand for HVCs . Gas feedstock for primary 
chemicals experiences the strongest increase among conventional feedstocks, growing by 36 % by 
2030 and by a further 22% by 2050. Gas feedstock’s growth, which  has a broad geographical 
base , is derived  primarily from  the rise in demand for ammonia and methanol. Use of coal as 
primary chemical feedstock grows initially, by 26% by 2030, but slows ther eafter. This trend is  PET

 Page | 76 first shaped by increasing demand for coal- base d methanol  production in facilities already in the 
pipe line in China, but soon after 2030,  methanol and ammonia demand are relatively flat . 
Ethane and naphtha remain the main feedstocks for HVC  production, with o ther oil products –  
LPG and gas oil, along w ith some refinery gases –  form ing the rest of the supply. Ethane is the 
preferable feedstock , where it is available, because  its price tends to be low relative to its high 
yield (0. 8 tonnes  of HVC s per tonne of ethane). However, few regions outside the United  States  
and the Middle  East have access to a  plentiful and cost -efficient  supply . Consequently, naphtha is 
the dominant feedstock globally, accounting for more than half of cumulative HVC production 
during 2017 -50. 
Ethane consumption for HVC producti on in the favoured regions grows by approximately 70% by 
2030 in the RTS, in part due to demand for exports to other regions, such as Europe. However, 
regions with continuing strong growth in HVC production after 2030 increasingly rely on other 
feedstocks,  mostly naphtha. This is mainly due to tightening ethane supply as a result of the 
flattening natural gas liquids (NGLs) output from United States (US) shale gas, and stagnating 
tight oil production in the second half of the 2020s. In the Middle East, wher e ethane feedstock 
grows b y around 70% in the period 2017 -30, growth slows to 17% between 2030 and 2050, 
whereas naphtha consumption more than quadruples over the same overall period. Naphtha 
overtakes ethane as the region’s largest feedstock by 2050. Were there an unlimited supply of 
ethane available, the chemical sector would readily absorb additional volumes (see Box 4.2).  
 Box 4.2 • Enthusiasm for ethane  
The effect of the US  shale revolution on global hydrocarbon supply is hard to overstate. Between 2010 and 
2017,  US shale gas output tripled to 4 77 bcm, while NGL output doubled to 3. 7 mb/d (net of condensate) . The 
incremental output of shale ethane, LPG and natural gasoline together equated to 20% of global oil demand 
growth over the same period. This led to lower prices for these pr oducts : US ethane prices dropped by about 
two-thirds, while propane prices fell by more than half. Even with increasing output  and switching from other 
feedstocks, the  US petrochemical sector could not absor b all the ethane supply growth.  
Pipeline infrastructure also initially constrained ethane delivery , putting huge pres sure on wellhead ethane 
prices, which even  fell below parity with natural gas prices in 2013, and only started recovering in 2016. This 
meant that producers cut ethane y ields, leaving some ethane molecules in the natural gas stream, rather than 
separating the whole ethane fraction, a practice known as “ethane rejection”. At its peak, some 
400- 600 thousand barrels per day ( kb/d)  of ethane was estimated to have been subject ed to such rejection . 
Demand, however, proved to be flexible. Low ethane prices ushered in a wave of petrochemical projects on 
the US Gulf Coast, which started coming online in 2014, and cumulative ethane cracking capacity additions 
between 2014 and 2017 reached nearly  4 Mt. This helped ethane prices and yields rebound. The start of 
regular ethane exports to Europe, in late 2016, and to India, in 2017, offered additional support. As soon as 
seaborne exports were possible, there was sufficient interest from global petrochemical operators.  
Given the attractive pricing of ethane relative to crude- derived  naphtha and its higher ethylene yields, ethane 
demand could, theoretically,  be significantly  higher than in the RTS, without increased demand for 
downstream chemical products.  Ethane feedstocks provide lower propylene yields than naphtha, which might 
have been a n obstacle, but propylene production from propane dehydrogenation ( PDH ) plants has gained a 
lot of traction  in the United  States and China  in recent ye ars. 
In the RTS, t hese two factors –  attractive pricing and new -found ethylene/propylene flexibility – help ethane 
demand to grow  to such an extent that, post -2025, it becomes impossible for supply to keep up. As  US shale 
gas production increasingly  moves towards drier plays (gas with lower quantities of NGLs) and US tight oil 
production levels out  in the 2020s, ethane supply reaches a peak in the late 2020s and then starts to decline . 
Without this constraint on supply,  HVC  demand could consume nearly 50% m ore than the ethane demand 
observed in the RTS, or 6. 7 mb/d by 2050. This suggests that, i f US shale output were to exceed expectations, 
the global petrochemical sector would readily  absorb the additional output . © OECD/IEA 201 8 The Future of Petrochemicals

Alternative feedstocks  for HVC  production grow  five-fold by 2030 and then almost triple  during 
the period 2030 -50. Despite this, they still account for just 2 % of global feedstock cons umption in 
2050. Bioethanol (used to make bioethylene) makes up most  of the alternative feedstock supply  
in 2050 in the RTS, contributing more than 95%. Most of this is consumed in Asia Pacific and 
Central and South America (mainly in Brazil), with small additional amounts (less than 
1 million  tonnes  of oil- equivalent [Mtoe ]) in Europe and North  America . Electrolysis -based routes 
to ammonia and methanol remain at the pilot project scale in the RTS, barely registering any 
production in global terms.  
The cons umption of feedstock for ammonia and methanol  production  tells a similar story . 
Globally, in the RTS, n atural gas provides the majority of the growth in feedstock consumption for 
both chemicals, but th eir uses of coal  diverge:  growth  for methanol  and stagnation  for ammonia . 
The distinction between ammonia and methanol stems from their differing growth trajectories in 
China, which remains the major centre for the use of coal as feedstock for both chemicals in the 
RTS. Whereas methanol continues growing strongly, leading to further coal -based capacity 
additions, ammonia production stagnates.  
MTO  projects (and those in the pipeline) lock  in significant amounts of coal- based methanol 
capacity, whereas no such outlet exists for ammonia. The MTO process  does  not make sense in 
the RTS unless the  methanol  is cheap . In China , this still means production based on coal, at least 
in the short term. Both the natural gas and coal routes to methanol, and then on to  HVCs , are 
motivated by rising  oil product prices in t he RTS. T he factors underlying these price dynamics can 
only be explored by looking at the broader  context of oil demand  (IEA, 2018) .  0 2 4 6 8

Oil demand for feedstock in the context  of the RTS  
Today t he production of chemicals requires oil as feedstock, so the growth of demand for 
primary chemicals – HVCs  in particular –  naturally translates into higher demand for oil products, 
predominantly naphtha, ethane and LPG. In 1990, global oil demand for chemic al feedstock 
represented just 8% of total oil demand. While oil demand in other sectors has been significantly 
impacted  by energy efficiency improvements and fuel switching, demand for chemical feedstock 
has continued its upward journey, increasing the  prominence  of the industry as a source  of oil 
demand.  With around 12  mb/d, global oil demand  for chemical feedstock accounted  for about 
12% of total oil demand in 201 7. The share is even higher (14%) when oil consumption for  
process energy in the chemical sector is included , though this figure is relatively small.   0 30 60 90 120 150

Page | 79  Figure 4.6 • Share of total oil demand by sector in the RTS  
 
Key message • Chemical feedstock plays an increasing  role in total oil deman d, with its share rising from 
12% in 2017  to 16% by 2050.  
In the context of the RT S (and more broadly in  the IEA New Policies Scenario ), oil demand growth 
is increasingly offset,  in many sectors , by a combination of energy efficiency, fuel switching and 
electrification. For example, despite the size of  the global  car fleet  more than doubling between 
2017  and 2050, oil demand for passenger vehicles flattens , mainly as a result of  improvement s in 
fuel economy  and, to a lesser extent, the uptake of electric and other alternative vehicles . 
Demand for other transport m odes is also affected by a  degree of efficiency improvement and 
fuel switching althou gh the impact is less prominent.  In buildings, oil faces increasing competition 
from natural gas and electricity,  particularly for space heating. And  in power generation, 
renewables and natural gas are increasingly substitute d for oil use in many regions.  
The dampening influence on  oil demand in these sectors do es not fully apply  in relation to  
chemical feedstock. The impact of energy efficiency and the electrification of heat pertain  to 
process energy requirements rather than to feedstock consumption . Although  certain trends in 
the RTS – such as recycling and  greater uptake of catalytic processes  – yield some feed stock 
savings, these are more than offset b y the robust growth in demand  for chemical products .  
Alternative feedstock s such as biomass or carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water do not gain a 
substantial share of chemical  feedstock in the R TS. As a result, global oil demand for chemical 
feedstock continues to grow by around  6 mb/d , to almost 18 mb/d in 2050, representing almost 
half of the total oil demand growth during that period. The share of chemical feedstock in total 
oil demand also increases from 12 % in 2017 to 16% in 2050. The figure is  18% (in volumetric 
terms) if process energy is included . 
Oil demand for chemical feedstock grows most in the Middle  East, where countries are 
increasingly moving  into the oil refining and petrochemical businesses as a mean s of increasing  
the value of their indigenous oil production and diversify ing their economies. Given the cost 
advantage over steam crackers in other regions, new crackers in the Middle  East  are likely to 
maintain higher utilisation  rates , adding 3  mb/d of feedstock deman d between now  and 2050. 
China follows  close ly behind , as national companies add new capacity to increase self- sufficiency 
in chemical production,  and independent refineries transform themselves into petrochemical 
companies. Feedstock consumption in the United States  grows until around 2030 before entering 
a period of gradual decline in the wake of tightening ethane supply from  shale formations. There 
is some growth in oil demand for feedstock in India and other developing economies in Asia .

 Page | 80  Box 4.3 • Oil supply security and petrochemicals  
Oil supply security has remained the cornerstone activity of the I EA since its creation in 1974. Each IEA 
member country has an obligation to hold  oil stock levels that equate to no less than 90 days of net imports 
and to have ready  emergency response mechanisms that can be ac tivated in the case of a crisis, such as a 
demand restraint .  
The primary purpose of collective emergency action by IEA member countries is to mitigate the economic 
damage associated with a disruption of oil supply. By temporarily replacing disrupted supplies or reducing 
demand the action is intended to help oil markets re- establish the supply/demand balance at a lower price 
level than would otherwise have been the case.  
At the time of the creation of the IEA, the petrochemical sector was sub stantially smaller than it is  today. As 
the primary concern of the countries establishing the IEA was to protect the economic activities hea vily 
dependent on oil as an energy source (notably  transport, power generation and heating), non- energy use was 
not included in the calculations  of stockholding requirements. This was done simply by excluding from the net -
import  calculation all flows  of na phtha and deducting a naphtha yield from amounts of crude oil, both to  
establish the basis for the stockholding obligation and to  determin e what type of stocks contribute to  the 
obligation.  
The situation is fundamentally different today. G rowing demand for  primary chemicals translates into 
considerable oil d emand. In the coming decades, petrochemical feedstock is projected  to be the strongest 
growth  segment of global oil demand. W ith oil products making up the overwhelming bulk of petrochemical 
feedstock supply , the petrochemical industry has a very strong  interest in assuring oil supply security.  
Whether or not the portion of the oil barrel that is used for petrochemicals should remain excluded from the 
stockholding calculation is part of an overall asse ssment currently underway at the IEA . This assessment, 
initiated by IEA m inisters at the ir November 2017 meeting, is designed to underpin any necessary 
improvement s in the emergency oil stockholding requirement s. 
 
Declining oil demand for chemical feedstock in advanced economies does not mean that the 
share of chemical feedstock in total oil demand shrinks in these regions. In fact , oil demand for 
chemical feedstock in these regions is also more resilient than demand  for other segments 
(e.g. road transport). Indeed, t he share of chemical feedstock in total demand increases in 
virtually every region.  
For example, in the European  Union , the share grows from 15% today to 21 % by 2050, 
approaching that of passenger vehicles by the end of the projection period , even though  demand 
for both sectors declines in absolute terms. In China, oil demand for both chemical feedstock and 
passenger vehicles grow s strongly until 2030 , but passenger transport demand then falls  as po licy 
efforts to improve fuel efficiency and promote electric vehicles lead to  the share  of the chemical 
industry  in total Chinese demand exceeding that of passenger transport by  2050. In the 
Middle  East, oil demand for both chemical feedstock and passenger  vehicles continue s to grow to 
2050, raising the shares of both segments at the expense of the share for power generation.    
The contribution of chemicals to oil demand growth is even more prominent within the industr y 
sector. While total industrial energy  consumption has grown by 60% over the past 2 5 years, oil 
has been continuously displaced by other fuels , such as natural gas and  renewables (or by 
electricity produced from these fuels), and it has registered virtually no growth  in absolute terms . 
This effect was mainly driven by the phas ing out of oil price subsidies,  environmental regulations , 
and the technical ease of substituti ng natural gas for oil in some industrial equipment,  such as 
boilers and furnaces . However,  in the more complex processes  of the chemical  sector, these 
substitutions have proven  more difficult.

Page | 81  Figure 4.7 • Shares of oil demand for chemical feedstock and passenger vehicles in the RTS   
 
Key message • The  growing  share of chemical feedstock in total oil demand surpasses that of  passenge r 
vehicles in certain regions.  
Various site - and process -specific constraints often make fuel switching investment -intensive  or 
incur  an energy penalty. Oil consumption for process energy in the chemical sector has grown by 
40% during the past 2 5 years, raising the share of chemi cals in total industrial oil consumption 
(when including both  process energy and feedstock) from 54% in 1990 to over 70% in 2017. In 
the RTS, this trend  continues through to 2050, albeit at a slower pace, elevating  the share of 
chemicals in industry oil consumption to around  80% by 2050.  
The rising share o f the chemical sector in global oil demand has consequences for  demand in a 
range of oil product s. Robust demand for chemical feedstock in the RTS translates into strong 
growth for lighter oil products such as naphtha, ethane and LPG , their combined demand growth 
amounting to 8 mb/d between today and 2050. Total d emand for middle distillates remains 
robust on the back of strong road freight and aviation activities, but demand for gasoline and 
high -sulphur  fuel oil declines. As a result, the share  in total demand  of the lighter – often dubbed 
“top of the barrel ” – products , used as chemical  feedstock c ontinues to grow, rising from 18 % in 
2017 to 23 % by 2050, at the expense of  the share of transport fuels, gasoline in particular. 
Refiners will need to adapt to the se changing product demand s (more on this in Chapter 5) .

 Page | 8 2 Process  selection is d riven by feedstock availability  in the RTS  
Production process trends in the RTS are dictated by the availability and economic attractiveness 
of feedstocks. The penetration rates  of different production processes therefore directly re flect  
feedstock decisions , especially in the case of processes supplying a single product, such as 
ammonia or methanol . 
For HVCs , the technology story is slightly more nuanced. Processes delivering multiple chemicals 
(e.g.  steam cracking) or a single one (e.g.  PDH) complement each other across various regions, 
with each region adopting  a process combination that makes best use of the m ost attractive 
feedstocks available. Thanks to the use of catalysts, naphtha catalytic cracking (NCC) produces 
HVC s with greater selectivity than standard steam cracking, but, as yet, only one such commercial 
plant is operating  (in Korea ).  
The energy efficiency of NCC  is roughly 15% higher than that of the world’s best performing 
naphtha steam cracker , and the process requires nearly 25% less naphtha feedstock per unit of 
HVC  produced. However, the process , which is relatively new and complex (involvin g a catalyst) , 
thus entails  a higher level of investment risk. Starting from this  modest level of installed capacity 
in 201 7, NCC achieves  only marginal deployment levels by 2050  in the RTS . In the Middle  East and 
Asia Pacific  respectively , 2% and 3% of to tal HVC production is produced through NCC by 2050.  
Single -product processes for HVC  production include bioethanol dehydration (BD H) and PDH . 
BDH is an attractive process route when only ethylene is required. It ranks second, after ethane 
steam cracking , in terms of ethylene yield. Most of the current installed capacity of BDH is 
located in Brazil. This  technology is deployed  in the RTS in most regions to some degree by 2050, 
especially where ethane is not abundant and bioethanol stocks are available,  ultimately 
contributing 3% of global HVC  supply.  
If LPG (which contains propane as a constituent) is available at a reasonable cost, PDH is an 
important strategy to bridge the “propylene gap”  that can emerge when there large amounts of 
ethane -based capacity or when high ratios of propylene to ethylene are required. T he 
deployment of PDH peaks before 2030 in the RTS, with more than half of its utilisation taking 
place in China by 2050 . 
MTO/MTA processes are  a special case among HVC  production technologies. These processes  
encompass a range of variations that facilitate both multi-  and single -product arrangements. 
Whereas MTA is at a demonstration phase  today , MTO is already commercial. A ll the existing 
global MTO capacity, which turns coal into HVCs  via meth anol, is in China.  Although MTO 
achieves significant growth in the first half of the RTS,  almost doubling by 2030, it levels off 
thereafter, due to rising fuel costs and its high capital intensity relative to other process options. 
No deployment of MTO tak es place outside China in the RTS.   
For methanol  production,  there is a distinction between the use of coal and COG, with the use of 
COG growing  in line with availability. COG is a by -product from producing coke, most of which is 
generated for use as a reducing agent in the iron and steel industry. Because the COG comes in 
gaseous form and already contains the main components of syngas (carbon monoxide and 
hydrogen) , used for making methanol, this process  is significantly less capital-  and energy -
intensive than making methanol using coal.  
All the existing  global COG- based methanol production is concentrated in China. Excess 
steelmaking capacity in China has led to the redirection of COG away from its traditional use as  
fuel in steel mill utilities  to feedst ock for methanol. I n the RTS, where global crude steel demand 
increases by around 30%  between 2017 and 2050 , there is  a limit on the amount of COG available 
sufficiently close  to chemical facilities to make its use for that purpose economic.  © OECD/IEA 201 8 The Future of Petrochemicals

Page | 83 Process changes in  the production of ammonia in the RTS are mainly tied to an increasing share 
of gas relative to coal globally. China maintains its coal-based ammonia capacity, but because its 
production levels stagnate and production in other regions continues t o grow , the overall process 
mix shifts towards  gas. The consequences for technology are straightforward.  
Approximately 6 0 Mt of ammonia production capacity based on coal (partial oxidation units using 
gasifiers ) is maintained and replaced as necessary in C hina between 201 7 and 2050 . Elsewhere, 
steam reformers  – which require less than half the investment needed  to build the equivalent 
capacity based on coal  – are used to construct the additional capacity required . The share of gas 
in global ammonia producti on rises from 63% in 201 7 to 74% in 2050.

 Page | 84  Box 4.4 • Least -cost modelling  
The modelling results that underpin this publication are generated using a cost -optimisation (TIMES -based) 
model of the chemical sector. The aim of the modelling architecture is to facilitate technology decision -making 
on a least -cost basis, specifically, discounted capital investment and fuel costs.  
The chemical secto r TIMES model covers 3 9 model regions (seven  aggregated reporting regions) and a 
detailed portfolio of technology options for the production of primary chemicals ( HVCs , methanol and 
ammonia). Primary chemicals account for around two-thirds  of the sector’s overall energy consumption. The 
remaining energy consumption in the sector, which is distributed across thousands of different products and 
facilities, is modelled using a simulation module.  
Each technology characterised in the model for primary chemicals  production is characterised with as much 
technological deta il as is feasible, including  yields, quantities of various by -products, capital expenditure, fixed 
operational expenditure, energy performance by fuel, emissions levels, construction and decommissioning 
times and vintages of plants.  
The model is driven by the need to satisfy regional demands for primary chemicals, which are projected and 
translated to their producing regions exogenously. Demand projections are based on country - or regional -
level d ata for GDP , disposable income, installed and announced industrial capacity, current material 
consumption, regional -demand saturation levels derived from historic al data,  and resource endowments. The 
model must satisfy these demands,  while conforming to va rious scenario -specific constraints, such as limits on 
the availability of certain fuels and on CO 2 emission s (allow ing for the need to supply urea plants with CO 2 
feedstock).  
The model interacts with other models in  the IEA via price signals ( e.g. for fu els), available alternative 
feedstocks ( e.g. COG ), and user constraints ( e.g. allocation of CO 2 emission quotas). The integrated and 
iterative approach is aimed at providing a coherent scenario that takes account of the complex 
interdependencies within the energy system. For this publication, the wider energy system context is provided 
by results from the World Energy Mo del, the latest results of which are described in the World Energy Outlook  
(IEA, 2017) . 
Feedstock and energy intensity of primary chemical production in the RTS  
The overall energy intensity of primary chemical production in the RTS in 2017 falls by 3.4% by 
2030 and by a further 2. 6% by 2050 . However, the feedstock intensity of primary chemicals stays 
relatively flat, declining gently , from 4 3.3 gigajoules per tonne ( GJ/t) in 201 7 to 42.7 GJ/t in 2030, 
and then climbing again to 4 3.9 GJ/t (or around 1 tonne of oil -equivalent per tonne ) in 2050. This 
reflects that, although the situation is more complicated for HVC s, in general, it takes a fixed 
amount of feedstock – akin to a material input –  to obtain a unit of chemical output. No 
significant ground -breaking improvements are envisaged for the yields from these large -volume 
chemical processes  because  it is assumed modern catalysis has already delivered most of the 
practical gains that can be achieved.  
Because multiple proc ess routes are available for high -value chemic al production, each of which 
has a different yield structure, the feedstock intensity for these chemicals does vary slightly, both 
geographically and over time. In the RTS, the feedstock intensity of HVC  produc tion declines 
initially, from 7 2.3 GJ/t of HVC in 201 7 to 69. 5 GJ/t of HVC  in 2030, and then rises again , to 
70.3 GJ/t of HVC in 2050. The initial fall in feedstock intensity stems from the increased share of 
lighter feedstocks by 2030, followed by a gentl e decline since  light feedstocks (such as ethane) 
tend to have higher yields . This undulating share of lighter feedstocks explains all of the variation 
in the global feedstock intensity. The feedstock intensity for methanol and ammonia remain s flat 
at nearly 2 0 GJ/t by 2050 because , for these chemicals, feedstock change does not imply a 
fundamental technological shift in the synthesis process.  © OECD/IEA 201 8 The Future of Petrochemicals

Page | 85  Figure 4.10 • Average  energy  intensity by primary chemical in the RTS  
 
Notes:  Net process energy intensities are depicted  for feedstock . In steam crackers, the conversion of feedstock to chemicals results 
by-product off -gases, which can be use d to provide process energy. When utilised , this reduce s the quantities of process energy 
required . The same is true for both am monia and methanol, but to a much lesser extent  becau se lower quantities of  calorific  gases 
are generated from the conversion of the feedstock.  
Key message • Feedstock intensity remains steady,  while process energy intensity declines.  
The net process energy intensity of primary chemical production falls from 16.2 GJ/t in 201 7 to 
14.7  GJ/t in 2030 , and further  in 2050 to 12.0 GJ/t. It is important to note these figures refer to 
the additional process energy required, after fuel gas generated by feedstock processing (mainly 
in HVC production) has been used. Energy efficiency measures and process integration drive 
these process energy -intensity reductions towards best -performing levels, reflecting  energy 
market dynamics and a suite of regional policy instruments. Some examples are energy efficiency 
improvement targets (such as the Perform Achieve Trade project in India), minimum equipment 
performance standards, adoption of energy management systems, gradual phase -out of the fossil 
fuel subsidies related to industrial use, and CO 2 emissions reduction targets (as in the nationally 
determined c ontributions  stemming from the Paris Agreement ). 
For ammonia, the declines in process energy intensity are the steepest, from 25. 1 GJ/t in 201 7 to 
22.8 GJ/t in 2030 and to 19.0  GJ/t in 2050. This drop of nearly a third by 2050 is more than twice 
the ra te of decline seen for methanol  and HVC  production. Most of the process energy intensity 
decline of a mmonia production is driven by the  increase in the glob al share of natural gas, 
relative to that of coal.  When us ing a heavier, solid feedstock to produce a chemical, it is 
generally the case that the process energy intens ity is higher. This is because extra energy is 
required to operate equipment for handling and processing the feedstock.  
Environmental impact of growing chemicals demand in the RTS  
Chemical sector CO 2 emissions  increase by more than 30% by 2050 in the RTS. Nearly t wo-thirds  
of this increase takes place before 2030, with  emissions continuing to climb more slowly during 
2030- 2050, reaching  just under  2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide per year (GtCO 2/y). Emissions 
levels in 2050 are virtually the same as  those in 2030. This gr owth in emissions is driven by the  
robust increase in primary chemical demand  – 32% by 2030 and 56 % by 2050 in the RTS , relative 
to 2017.   
Sustaining this increase in primary chemical production while limiting increases in CO 2 emissions 
to 32% means that  a significant decrease in the CO 2 emissions intensity of chemical activities  is 
achieved . In fact, t he emissions intensity of primary chemical production overall decreases from 
1.7 tonnes  of carbon dioxide per tonne ( tCO 2/t) in 2017  to 1. 4 tCO 2/t in 2050 in the RTS –  nearly a  0 15 30 45 60 75 90

 Page | 86 20% reduction.  For all primary chemicals, this reduction is driven primarily by shifts to lighter 
feedstocks and the achievement over time of  best energy performance levels.  
Today, producing a tonne of ammonia results in approximately 2. 4 tonnes  of direct CO 2 emissions 
on average, with the figure s for methanol being 2. 3 tonnes  and 1.0 tonnes  for HVCs . All regions 
exhibit steady declines in emissions intensity for all primary chemical production throughout the 
RTS.  
Whereas methanol  tends to be at the lower end of the emissions intensity spectrum for the 
production of primary chemicals  in most regions,  today it is the most emissions- intensive among 
those produced in Asia  Pacific . The emissions impact of gradual improvements in energy 
efficiency for all production  processes offsets the decreasing share of COG in the feedstock mix 
for methanol production, resulting in modest improvements in emissions intensity. Capacity 
based on COG –  a less emissions -intensive process route – remains fairly level, but coal- based 
capacity additions in China continue to rise, meaning that methanol remains the most emissions -
intensive primary chemical in the region, in both 2030 and 2050.  
Ammonia production is also more emissions -intensive  in Asia Pacific  than elsewhere. This is  again 
a result of Chinese coal- based production , which persists in China throughout the RTS . This coal-
based capacity is new and efficient, leaving limited scope for emissions -intensity reductions 
related to energy efficiency improvements . However, the capacity additions in other countries in 
the Asia Pacific  region are considerable and based on gas , which has the effect of gradually 
lowering t he emissions intensi ty for the region as a whole .  
For HVC  production, the capacity installed in Asia  Pacific  is new, efficient and , therefore , 
consistently the least emissions -intensive production centre for these chemicals. Because this 
capacity is already quite close to best -performance levels, relatively small gains take place in the 
RTS.  
Outside Asia Pacific, the sharpest declines in emissions intensity are achieved in Eurasia and 
Africa (ammonia and HVCs) and Europe (ammonia). Beyond feedstock choice, the age of existing 
plants in a given region is an important factor in the level of CO 2 emission s intensity for all 
products. Regions with younger plants (e.g.  Asia Pacific) typically rely on state -of-the-art 
technologies and, thus, have higher levels of energy performance; this means smaller gains are 
available in absolute terms. In the shorter term , this is mainly driven by the shift towards ethane 
and LPG in steam cracking. As supplies of these lighter oil products grow tighter after 2030, the 
additional use of naphtha and gas oil does not offer scope for any further reductions in CO 2 
intensity. Th e CO 2 intensities of production processes for HVCs undergo the steepest 
improvements in North  America, Africa, the Middle  East and Eurasia.  
The final factor that reduces the CO 2 emissions intensity in the RTS is the application of CCUS. The 
volume of CO 2 utilised for urea production grows by nearly 50% during 2017 -50. Ammonia offers 
the greatest scope for emissions reductions. The fact that around a quarter of the emissions not 
captured and used at present are process emissions, which are highly concentrate d, means that 
decarbonisation can take place at relatively low cost. Process CO 2 emissions from ammonia 
production are the primary source of CO 2 for this application, accounting for 97% of the CO 2 
cumulatively utilised between 2017 and 2050. No dilute CO 2 emission streams have capture 
processes applied in the RTS.  © OECD/IEA 201 8 The Future of Petrochemicals

Page | 87  Figure 4.11 • CO 2 emission intensities  in the RTS  
 
Note: CSA = Central and South America . 
Key message • Gentle declines in CO 2 emissions intensity take place for all chemicals across all regions . 
Deployment of carbon capture and storage ( CCS) in the RTS is  limited to regions in which the 
existing infrastructure, political environment and public attitudes are  favourable: North  America , 
and Asia Pacific . The expansion of the 45Q tax credit in the Unit ed States  lays the groundwork for 
further development of  CCS projects. Chemical industry CCS projects offering  nearly 
10 million  tonnes  of carbon dioxide ( MtCO 2) of annual capture capacity are at various stages of 
development in the United  States  and are anticipated to come online around the 2020s. China  is 
developing c hemical industry CCS projects with an overall capacity of 1. 3 MtCO 2 annual capture, 
with operation due to start in the early 2020s. T hese firm announcements are realised in the RTS , 
resulting in the cumulative capture of approximately 375 MtCO 2 for storage in the RTS between 
2017 and 2050. The Netherlands has announced a target  to store 1 8 MtCO 2 annually by 2030, all 
from industrial point sources (Dutch Government Parties Coalition, 2017) . However, without firm 
and specific commitments, this capacity is not realised in the RTS.  
Globally, the amounts of key air pollutants – NO x, SO 2 and PM 2.5 – generated in combustion 
processes per unit of primary chemical output decrease globally: on average, by more than 30% 
by 2050 in the RTS. In the case of SO 2, the figure more than halves. In the RTS, the average air 
pollutant intensity of primary chemical production decreases from  4.7 tonnes per kt of primary 
chemical in 2017 to a little over 2.6  tonne s per kt of primary chemical in 2050.  
Once again, a gradual decline in the share of coal- based production in Asia  Pacific yields 
significant benefits, leading to a flattening of air pollutant emissions, especially SO 2, which 
decline by more than 20% by 205 0, despite an increase of more than 60% in the production for 
primary chemicals. This effect is diluted slightly at the regional level in Asia Pacific owing to a 
small increase in coal used for process energy elsewhere in the region. NO x levels in the RTS 
undergo a worrying increase by 2050 in Africa and in the Middle  East (both increasing by just 
under 25%), mainly because of the use of some heavy oil as process energy in HVC production.

use or at the end of life of goods containing plastic. This waste can “leak” into the environment, 
frequently making its way into water courses and eventually into the ocean, where it damages 
marine life and ecosystems. It is estimated that around 100  Mt of plastic waste is already in the 
oceans and that this amount is increasing by 5 -15 Mt per year (Jambeck et al., 2015; Ocean 
Conservancy, 2015) . However, the data on this phenomenon are plagued by uncertainty, as much 
of the leakage takes place in areas with little or no waste management.  
If no action is taken, the current rate of plastic waste leakage  is likely to result in more than a 
doubling of  cumulative plastic waste in the oceans by 2030, and a continuing rise thereafter.  This 
is a starkly unaccept able feature of the RTS. This environmental problem has received more 
atten tion from the public in recent years, yielding policy developments in the form of 
commitments to action by governments  to drastically decrease plastic leakage to the 
environment . 
Increases in recycling rates observed in recent years, particularly in Europe, are positive 
developments that are expected to continue in the RTS. However, these increases do not in 
themselves result in the mitigation of plastic leakage, given that there a re still large quantities of 
non-recycled plastic waste that can be mismanaged. The European Strategy for Plastics in a 
Circular Economy  (European Union,  2018)  is cause for encouragement, though specific legal 
instruments are yet to materialise. Without ambitious action being taken globally, particularly in 
regions in which plastic demand is growing rapidly, current trends of plastic leakage are unlikely 
even to slow, let alone reverse.  
Scattered waste volumes, including plastic waste, can often prevent waste management 
businesses from conducting profitable operations, in order to reduce the costs of this essential 
public service. Simultaneously, lack o f means or information can prevent consumers and private 
entities from disposing adequately of the waste they generate.   0 300 600 9001 2001 500

Notes:  Quantities of plastic leakage are estimated based on projections of plastic waste and estimat es of current rates of leakage, the 
latter of which are assumed to remain constant. The range presented for cumulative estimates reflects the range of estimates for 
current rates of leakage. The ranges for annual quantities are omitted for clarity.  
Source : Estimates of current rates of leakage from  Jambeck, J.R. et al. (2015), “Plastic waste inputs from land into the ocean”, 
https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1260352 . 
Key message • By  2050, the quantity of plastic in the ocean exceeds  500 Mt in the RTS (with a n estimated 
range of 320- 860 Mt), rising far beyond already unacceptable levels.  
Digital technologies can transform  waste management systems by connecting waste generators 
with a local recovery service . They  can facilitate on -demand waste recovery , tailored  to each 
specific waste material. Smart sensors installed in collection containers can facilitate  the sorting 
of waste and so  reduc e waste recycling costs. The smart waste collec tion market is estimated to 
have the potentia l to grow almost fourfold by 2025, reaching about USD  224 million  globally 
(Navigant, 2016) . 
Global freshwater withdrawals  for primary chemical production more than triple  during 
2017- 50, ris ing to 1 2 bcm . Indirect water withdrawals accoun t for most of the increase and , as a 
result , the  share of total indirect water withdrawals for primary chemical output rises to almost 
95%. Water withdrawals for the first few  years remain relatively stable , due to counteracting 
changes in the power sect or that affect withdrawals.  The retirement of less -efficient subcritical 
coal plants (replaced in part by supercritical and ultra- supercritical coal plants) depresses water 
withdrawals, while more nuclear and concentrated solar power increases withdrawals.  
Water consumption increases from nearly 2 bcm in 201 7 to nearly 5 bcm by 2050, consumption 
as a share of primary chemical- related water withdrawals rising slightly from 4 6% to 48% over 
the same timeframe. The high share of consumption , relative to withdrawals , is due to  heavy 
reliance on coal, oil and natural gas for chemical processes. Primary energy production is the 
largest source of water consumption in the energy sector. As with withdrawals, indirect 
consumption is responsible for the majority of the in crease.   
Asia Pacific  accounts for approximately half of cumulative primary chemical production in the 
RTS. As a result, the trend  in water use for primary chemicals  in Asia Pacific  underpin s many of 
the changes at the global level . The region accounts for roughly 80% of the global increase in 
both withdrawal and consumption of water for these products. A more than ten -fold global 
increase in bioenergy production  (albeit from minimal levels today) , mostly in Asia  Pacific , 
underpins mu ch of the rise in water demand because  biofuels are the  largest source of water 
withdrawals and consumption in primary energy production.  
Similarly, greater use of electricity for chemical processes pushes up water use. An improvement 
in the average level  of efficiency of China’s coal fleet derives from  the decline in the share of coal-
fired generation from subcritical power plants. China also shifts away from coal- fired generation  0 200 400 600 8001 000

withdrawals but temper the rate of decline in consumption. Despite its declining share, coal still 
plays a critical role in power generation in the RTS, as doe s nuclear, thus  elevating  water 
demand.  
 Figure 4.14 • Water demand for primary chemical production in  the RTS  
Notes:  Direct water demand estimates for primary chemical production include water uses for feedstock (e.g.  steam cracking). Water 
demand for process heating is excluded due to the wide range of possible configurations for steam systems across chemical sites.  
Key message • Asia  Pacific  accounts for about 80% of the global increase in water withdrawal and 
consumption for primary chemicals . 
As discussed in Chapter 3, many countries already face some degree of water stress , and it i s 
estimated that, by 2050, 5 billion people could suffer water shortages (WWPA and UN Water, 
2018) . Though water use  in primary chemical production  is low , compared to other sectors, 
certain regions that are already, or are projected to become , large chemical producers, are  likely 
to face water stress. Water availability could , therefore, become an inhibiting factor for primary 
chemical production. This makes understanding and managing water inputs all the more 
important  in order  to ensure that the chemical sector does not unduly affect  water resources or 
become constrained by water resource considerations. Key chemical-producing regions such as 
China, the Middle  East and parts of the southern United  States  are all expected to experience 
high or extremely high levels of water stress (WRI, 2018).  0 250 500 7501 0001 250

Page | 93 Chapter 5. Towards  a clean chemical sector  
In this chapter, an alternative future for the chemical sector is explored , using the Clean 
Technology Scenario  (CTS; see Box 5.1). In contrast to the analysis in Chapter 4, which projects 
the development of the sector based on  existing policies and intentions , the CTS works 
backwards from a pre -defined end -point, derived from  the United Nations Sust ainable 
Development Goals . These express  an ambition to “end poverty, protect the planet and ensure 
prosperity for all ” (United Nations, 2018c) .  
The wider boundary of this analysis  is intended to address aspects o f Sustainable Development 
Goals 3, 6, 7, 13, 14 and 15, and ai ms to demonstrate the feasibility of concurrently addressing 
multiple facets of sustainability. A  clean chemical sector has much to contribute to such a 
sustainable future, which  goes well beyond limiting climate change. The CTS  explores 
opportunities to m itigate  air and water pollution, and the water demand associated with primary 
chemical production, alongside the over -arching goal of reducing carbon dioxide ( CO 2) emissions.  
Taking CO 2 emissions from the chemical sector as an indicator of the level of am bition set in the 
analysis, the level of emissions in 2050 relative to the Reference Technology Scenario ( RTS) 
explored in Chapter 4, must be 60% lower in the CTS. This must be achieved in a sector in which 
demand for primary chemicals increases by a round  40%, despite sharp increases in plastic 
recycling rates. Alongside these substantial CO 2 emission reductions, emissions of air and water 
pollutants must be steeply reduced , and solutions for these to be  even ceased  must be explored,  
if the chem ical sector is to follow a more -sustainable trajectory.  
 Box 5.1 • The CTS  
The CTS was generated using the same tools and meth odologies as those of the RTS (s ee Box 4.4). For 
example, process choices are still based on  minimising capital investment and fuel costs , but with the addition 
of various constraints. The key additional constraint is that the model requires  direct CO 2 emissions to be 
reduced by 45% by 2050,  compared to current levels, despite a 4 0% increase in primary chemical  output . 
This is not the only additional cons traint. The assumptions made about the extent of the required mitigation 
of other environmental impacts, such as those rel ated to air pollution and water  and about other aspects of 
the future energy system , are in line with those adopted in the IEA Sustainable Development Scenario . 
Featured for the first time in the World Energy Outlook (IEA, 2017) , the Sustainable Development Scenario 
takes a fundamentally different approach from the New Policies Scenario  of the World Energy Outlook , to 
which the RT S is aligned .  
The Sustainable Development Scenario  takes as its starting point a vision of where the ener gy sector needs to 
go and works back from that to the present, rather than projecting forward from today’s trends.  The 
Sustainable Development Scenari o contributes to the achievement of three core goals (derived from the 
energy -related aspects of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals) :  
 
• universal access to modern energy services by 2030, including not only access to ele ctricity but also clean 
cooking  
• objectives of the Paris Agreement  on climate change, including a peak in greenhouse gas emissions being 
reached as soon as possible, followed by a substantial decline  in such emissions  
• a large reduction in other energy -related pollutants, to deliver  a dramatic improvement in global air 
quality and a consequent reduction in premature deaths from household air pollution.  
These goals have direct implications for sectors beyond the energy sector, including the chemical sector, 
mainly by raising pr ices or lowering the availability of certain fuels. For example, the increased demand for 
liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG), relative to other oil products,  for clean cooking in developin g economies limits 
the supply available to other sectors , and increases i ts price. LPG currently accounts for around 16% of oil 
feedstock for primary chemical production.  The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8 
Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers  
 Page | 94 Slower, but continuing growth in primary chemical demand  
As discussed in Chapter 1, chemical products play an instrumental role in facilitating a sustainable  
transition of the energy system and the economy more broadly. As a result, the growth in 
primary chemical demand remains robust in our CTS projections. Demand for primary chemicals 
increases by almost 30 % by 2030 and around 40 % by 2050 in the CTS, around 4 and 
13 percentage points less  than in the RTS , respectively. The shares of benzene, toluene and 
mixed xylenes ( BTX) and high -value chemicals  (HVCs) being sourced from the refining sector 
remain the same as in the CTS.  
These slower rates of growth are att ributable to increased plast ic recycling, which reduces the  
demand for virgin plastic.  The demand for plastic overall is assumed to be the same in the CTS as 
in the RT S. New end uses of plastic  (e.g. plastic components in electric vehicles)  are likely to 
provide new avenues for growth, while others, such as single -use plastics are likely to be phased 
out in the context of the CTS. Projecting  these developments is plagued by uncertainty, so the 
overall demand is kept constant in the core results,23 in order t o isolate the effect of increased 
recycling.  
 Figure 5.1 • Global primary chemical production by scenario  
 
Note: Mt = million  tonnes . 
Key message • Substantial incre ases in plastic recycling lower  demand for primary chemicals by 7% by 
2050 in the CTS relative to the RTS. The differences are most noticeable for HVCs . 
Plastics recycling  
Waste plastic collection rates, recycling yield rates and the extent to which recycled plastics 
displace demand for  their virgin counterparts all increase substantially in the CTS. Secondary 
plastic production volumes from recycled resins increase by 65% in the CTS , compared to the 
RTS, by 2030, and more than double  by 2050. This results in 16 million  tonnes  (Mt) of primary 
chemical savings by 2030  and about 70  Mt by 2050. Plastic recycling is a key underlying source 
of emission s reductions in the CTS . 
As discussed in Chapter 4, the changing regional shares of plastic consumption over time have 
a significant impact on  global average rates of plastic waste collection. In the RTS, global 
average collection rates increase by 25% , from relatively low levels today. Large increases in

Page | 95 several mature economies, notably Europe, are dampened by increasing shares of plastic 
consumption in regions where collection rates are low.  
In the CTS, the trend is much more positive . Already by 2030, the global average collection rate  
has nearly doubl ed, and almost  tripled  by 2050 . This is mainly because  developing regions with 
strong growth in plastic consumption ( e.g. the People’s Republic of China, In dia and developing 
economies in Southeast Asia ) increase  their collection rates from today’s negligi ble levels , 
attaining those currently observed in Europe  by 2050. To achieve a  full transition to the CTS , 
developed countries  must  achieve collection rates for certain resins in excess of 75% by 2050 – a 
significant technical challenge. Europe, Japan and Korea manage this in the RTS, but are  joined by 
the majority of mature economies in the CTS, cementing the impact.  
Increases in recycling yields also gather pace in the CTS, r ising  from an average of around 75% in 
2017 to nearly 85% in 2050. Displacement rates double , from around a third in 201 7 to two-
thirds  in 2050. Again,  significant technical advances in recycling processes will be required . 
Efficient, closed loop recycling of  large portions of total plastic waste must be achieved by 2050 , 
whereas many sectors today have only  a few inefficient options available.  
 Figure 5.2 • Impact of recycling by scenario  
 
Note s: Error bars show the range of resin -specific global average collection rates.  Projected volumes of total plastic production are 
independent of the level of recycling. The impact of recycling is registered in the lowering of demand for primary chemicals.

Key message • By 2050, the p lastic waste collection rate for recycl ing more than doubl es in the CTS , 
relative to the RTS, delivering around 70  Mt of primary chemical savings . 
Regional differences affect both the shares of demand for  different  plastic resins, and those 
within waste streams. The resin composition of waste s treams does not match that leaving the 
factory gate and entering the built environment, because of the different lifetimes of each end  
use ( e.g. packaging or buildings). Strong demand today for short -lived plastics results in large 
volumes in waste streams  tomorrow.  This is why growth in collection rates, must be broad -based 
in the CTS, not just across regions, but also across resins . By 2050 in the CTS , the lower end of the 
range of average resin collection rates ( e.g. those for polystyrene) approaches  the upper end of 
the range today ( e.g. average rates for polyethylene terephthalate ). 
Feedstock changes in  a sustainable transition

Page | 96 about 70  Mt of primary chemical savings achieved in 2050 in the CTS, relative to the RTS , 95% are 
HVCs. Three -quarters of the HVC savings are olefins (ethylene and propylene), and the remainder 
are BTX aromatics. Because feedstock for HVCs  currently comes  almost entirely from oil – and 
continues to do so  in the RTS – the impacts of increased recycling on feedstock demand in the 
CTS are primarily reflected in reduced oil demand, although the impact is not as large as one 
might expect.  
 Figure 5.3 • Feedstock demand in the RTS and CTS  
Notes:  COG = coke oven gas.  Electricity used as feedstock for electrolysis -based hydrogen production.  Electricity denotes the use of 
electrolytic hydrogen, and is displayed in terms of electricity input.  
Key message • More than 90% of the impact of plastic recycling in 2050 is felt by oil feedstock.  
Oil feedstock demand for primary chemical production in the CTS is 5% lower in 2030 and 13% lower in 2050, relative to the RTS. T he other fuels used as feedstock  see even smaller declines, 
with natural gas consumption actually  increas es in the CTS, as it displaces coal. The  relatively 
modest dec lines between scenarios , despite large collection rate increases,  are due  to three main 
factors:   
•First, there is the time- lag of plastic products entering the waste stream after use, a period
which varies between months and decades, depending on the product application. Underlyin
g
t
his analysis is a stock model for the key plastics considered, used to estimate the impact of
this delay, and thus the quantity and composition of the plastics available to recycle. Whileplastic demand is growing, as it does throughout the CTS, the volumes available to recycle arealways smaller than those being produced.
•Second, a recycling yield loss is incurred. Although recycling yield s increase over time in th
e
C
TS, even in 2050, the quantities of secondary plastic  produced are around 10- 15%  less than
the quantity of scrap plastic used to produ ce them.
•And finally, there is a limited extent to which secondary plastic materials can displace  primary
plastic demand, and therefore reduce primary chemical production. The displacement rateincreases dramatically in the CTS, reflecting both technological advances and a strong policy
push, for example in  the area of closed loop recycling. However, in 2050, still around a third of
the secondary plastics considered are not able to provide direct substitutes for their virgin
counterparts
.
A
s described in Chapter 4, the overall impact of the increased recycling efforts is further  
diminished by the fact that the collection, yield and displacement rates are  multiplicative.  
A last aspect to note is the incomplete scope of the primary chemical value chains considered.

Page | 97 account of all derivatives and their recycling potential nearly impossible. T he key thermo plastics 
incorporate d in the analysis of recycling account for about  half of total primary chemical demand , 
and more than almost 85%  of total HVC demand  in 2050 in the CTS . The remainder is for a huge 
roster  of other chemical products, such as synthetic fibre and rubber, whic h are considered to 
have more limited potential for recycling, relative to the key thermoplastics considered.  
Implications for oil supply  and refining  
In the RT S, growing oil demand for chemical feedstock and declining demand for oil products for 
passenger vehicles shift  the overall pattern of oil product demand, with “top of the barrel”  
products taking an  increasing proportion . This effect is  amplified in the CTS (and also in the IEA  
Sustainable Development Scenario ), in which chemicals take th e lead between the two main end  
uses in many regions.  
 Figure 5.4 • Per capita  oil demand for selected end uses in the CTS  
 
Note s: toe/capita = tonne of oil- equivalent per capita. Oil demand for plastic consumption is calculated based on global average HVC 
energy intensities, including both feedstock and process energy, to reflect that plastics are widely traded.  
Key message • By 2050, per  capita  oil demand for plastic consumption over- takes that of road passenger 
transport in several regions in the CTS . 
Enhanced e fforts are made in these sustainable scenarios to decarbonise other modes of 
transport, for example, through systematic improvements in road freight operations or much 
larger uptake of alternative fuels in shipping and aviation. In  petrochemicals in the CTS,  a growing 
share of bio -based feedstock and wider uptake of plastic recycling results in a nearly 3 million 
barrels per day ( mb/d ) reduction in oil demand for chemical feedstock in 2050 , relative to  the 
RTS. However , the demand for oil for this purpose  still grows . The share of chemical feedstock in 
total oil demand more than doubles , from 12 % in 2017 to 26 % by 2050, much higher than the 
16% in the RT S. This shift in the balance of sectoral demand poses a n unprecedented  challenge to 
the refining industr y. 0.5 toe/capita

 Page | 98  Figure 5.5 • Oil demand for chemical feedstock and share in total oil demand by scenario  
 
Key message • The share of chemical feedstock in total  oil demand in the CTS is much higher than in the 
RTS, despite lower absolute volumes , because oil demand for other sectors declines  much more sharply . 
In the CTS, the shift in demand is acute  in transport fuels , with demand for gasoline and diesel 
falling by 1 6 mb/d and 1 3 mb/d respectively between 2017 and 2050. Fuel oil demand more than  
halves and kerosene demand declines by 30% over the same period. However, demand for the 
products used as a chemical feedstock remains relatively resilient , with naphtha, ethane and LPG 
demand registering positive growth over the analysed  period. In 2050, the shar e of these  three 
major feedstocks in total oil demand amounts to 35%, significantly higher than 18 % in 2017 . 
The shifting demand towards lighter products in this scenario will  force refiners to rethink their 
operation al strategy. Light tight oil (LTO) may offer a helping hand.  Prior to the growth of LTO 
production i n the United  States , global crude oil production had been getting heavier, with the 
share of heavier crude growing  from 13% in 2000 to 16% in 2011; but the recent surge in  
United  States  (US)  LTO production,  which is expected to continue over the next ten years , will 
reverse this trend, easing the supply position for petrochemical feedstock.  
Light crude oil has certain drawbacks as a refinery feedstock ( e.g. limited  scope  to remove  
hydrocarbon gas es), but it facilitate s the supply of a higher proportion of lighter oil products. It 
can be particularly  attractive for refinery facilities integrated with petrochemical operation s, or 
for those located in Asia, a  region that relies  on imports to meet its  growing appetite for chemical 
feedstock s, such as naphtha and LPG. The combination of  US LTO and condensate production will 
help refiners to meet the changing patterns of product demand in the  medium term  observed in 
the CTS . 
Long- term might be a differen t story. There is some uncertainty over the durability of the surge 
in US LTO production . In our analysis, it  continues to grow until the mid -2020s, dominating global 
production growth , but the  tide turns after the mid -2020s , when  production peak s and begins to 
fall, reduc ing the  availability of lighter crude. Moreover, the projected peak in  US LTO production 
coincides with the period when  the mismatch between the configuration s of refineries (as it 
stands at present) and product demand becomes acu te – for example, gasoline demand starts to 
plummet from the mid -2020s. Historically, t he refining industry has shown a remarkable capacity 
to adapt to changing market environments, but a combination of lower overall demand, shifting 
product demand pattern s and reduced long- term availability of lighter crude in the CTS , will set a 
new order  of challenges.   0 4 8 12 16 20 24

Page | 99  Figure 5.6 • Change in oil products demand in the CTS , 2017- 50 
 
Key message • Chemical feedstock is the  most enduring use of oil in the CTS, underpinning a large -scale 
shift towards “ top of the barrel ” products.  
The change in the pattern of product demand will have ripple effects. Falling gasoline demand 
means that the large component of naphtha that is currently converted into gasoline 
components may no longer  be need ed for this purpose, suggesting that more naphtha may  be 
available to  the petrochemical market. However,  the supply of ethane continues to tighten in this 
scenario , as shale gas development increasingly moves away from wet plays to drier plays  (those 
with fewer natural gas liquids (NGLs)) , albeit later than in the RTS.  
The share of LPG in petrochemical feedstock  is likely to be reduced , due to the combined effect 
of limit ed supply and growing demand from other sectors. LPG is usually supplied from refineries 
or by f ractionating NGLs.  Lower oil demand in the CTS translates into lower refinery utilisation, 
implying a lower supply of LPG from this source . Furthermore, NGLs are a by -product of natural 
gas production, so their supply tends to be det ermined principally  by demand for natural gas  – in 
other words, LPG price signals from the demand side do not necessarily trigger a supply 
response . The supply of LPG in this scenario , therefore , remains substantially lower than in the 
RTS.  
Meanwhile, the re are s table or growing needs for LPG across  various sectors , in particular, in 
response to the S ustainable Development  Goal of providing universal energy  access by 2030, one 
aspect of which is access to clean cooking  facilities . LPG is a  common solution to this challenge , 
especially in urban areas. For example, in  2016,  India  rose t o the third place among the largest 
LPG importers in the world, reflecting its success, since 2010, in halting the rise in the number of 
people without access to clean cooking, despite  a rapidly growing population. A growing appetite 
for LPG in this scenario is also visible in other  demand  sectors. For example, LPG makes further 
inroads in transport , due to its relatively low  emissions of various air pollutants . 
The significant reduction of gasoline and diesel demand in the CTS  does not bode well for the  
traditional pricing dynamic , whereby profits from gasoline and diesel determine refinery 
earnings. Re finers will therefore be forced t o consider other source s of income . Raising prices for 
naphtha and LPG could be one solution , but it is hard to imagine a rise in prices taking place that 
fully compensate s for the losses from gasoline and diesel sales . 
One possible response to the challenges of this increasingly competitive refinin g landscape is 
refining -petrochemical integration , as already discussed in Chapter 2.  Closely tying refining and 
petrochemical operations (beyond just co -location) offers a chance for companies to increase 
chemical product yields, enhance feedstock flexibility and increase income . Integration can be 
aided further by technologies , such as high -olefins fluid catalytic cracking, which can produce 
much higher volumes of ethylene and propylene (over 30% compared to less than 10% in - 20- 15- 10- 5 0 5 10

 Page | 100 conventional technologies). Th ese technologies allow fluid catalytic cracking units to produce 
more chemical products , relative to  gasoline products , and therefore help companies to cater for 
changing product demand. There are other operational benefits too.  
 Figure 5.7 • Global gasoline demand and  US tight liquids production in the CTS  
 
Key message • The projected peak in US LTO production in the mid -2020s coincides with the timing of the 
expected sharp fall in gasoline demand . 
Deeper integration allows a considerable cost reduction via economies of scale, process 
optimisation across a diverse facility and infrastructure sharing. There is also the chance to use 
“non-monetised ” products from one operation in another operation, for example, using surplus 
hydrogen from chemical facilities in refining operations or using refinery gases for 
petrochemicals. The scene seems to be set for the further blurring of the boundary between 
refining and petrochemicals businesses.  Crude -oil-to-chemicals  is an example of a technology 
that may be adopted in such a context.  
The need for lighter crude  oil, which is best -suited for integrated facilities, favo urs the regions 
producing this grade , such as the United  States , West Africa and the Russia n Federation . For the 
petrochemical industry, standalone  steam crackers that procure naphtha from outside are likely 
to face great er challenges. Plummeting gasoline demand –  and the refore increased availability of 
naphtha – may  push down naphtha prices. F or standalone  crackers,  this effect could be  offset by 
the rise of integrated facilities, reducing the amount of naphtha  freely available in the market . 
Mapping the clean transition  
Collective action throughout the value chain will be required to accomplish the multiple goals set 
in the CTS and a suite of technologies and operational choices are available in the chemical sector 
to facilitate the transition  from the RTS to the CTS. Fro m the perspective of the necessary CO 2 
emission reductions (the main driving force behind the scenario), the deployment of carbon 
capture, utilisation and storage ( CCUS ) plays a critical role in the necessary transformation of 
primary chemical production, accounting for around 35% of the emission reductions by 2050. 
Shifting to natural gas from process routes dependent on coal  delivers a further 25% of the 
reductions, with coal almost phased -out globally by 2050. Although powerful, this mitigation 
option ca nnot be repeated. Energy efficiency, state -of-the-art technology, process integration 
and effective operational practices are also instrumental, accounting for a further 25% of 
reductions.  The deployment of innovative alternative feedstocks , together with the impacts of 
recycling contribute a further 1 5%.  03691215

Page | 101 There are interactions  between mitigation options that d epend on the measures taken. For  
example, the installation of carbon capture equipment typically increases the specific energy 
intensity of a given process, as additional energy is needed to operate the CO 2 separation an d 
handling equipment. This  then affects  the share, magnitude and role of energy efficiency in the 
facilitation of CO 2 emission reductions.  Plastic recycling is , however,  independently sustainable. 
By reducing the demand for primary chemicals, this measure not only avoids CO 2 emissions, but 
also diminishes air pollutants and water demand and  reduces the generation of waste, thus 
helping to prevent its leakage into the environment.  
As always,  the key determining choices e n route  to a sustainable future are energy costs 
(including feedstock) and the capital expenditure required for process equipment. In the CTS, 
both bioenergy and electricity prices tend to increase over time, whereas fo ssil fuel prices tend to 
flatten out  or even decrease. This divergence arises from the fact that , in a CTS context, the 
demand for low -carbon energy carriers increases  throughout the energy system, whereas fossil 
fuels are in decline.  
For example, the bui ldings sector sheds demand for natural gas for space heating and replaces it , 
in part , by electricity, which is supplied by a power sector that has decreased its CO 2 emissions 
intensity by around 80% by 2040 , relative to current levels . The transport secto r reduces its 
consumption of fossil -based liquid fuels, switching in part to biofuels.  
These dynamics depress prices for fossil fuels and drive up the prices for their alternatives. 
Although t he CTS indicates  that specific capital expenditure for less mat ure alternative 
technologies actually  is reduced over time , as they get scaled up , capital expe nditure generally 
plays a small role in primary chemical production on a levelised cost basis, relative to energy 
costs.  
 Figure 5.8 • Cumulative direct CO 2 emission reduction s in the CTS  
 
Notes:  Cumulative direct CO 2 emission reductions refer to primary chemical production and not to the total chemical sector , and 
cover the period 201 7-50. Coal to natural gas savings include  the reduction of process emissions in the production of methanol and 
ammonia. CO 2 emission savings resulting from feedstock shifts within the same energy commodity (e.g.  naphtha to ethane) are  
included in energy efficiency.  
Key message • A broad range of options is  required to deliver the CTS transition in primary chemical 
production.  
CCUS 
The diverging energy price context between fossil fuels and low carbon energy carriers –  
particularly between natural gas and electricity –  largely un derpins the leading role of CCUS 
among innovative low -CO 2 processes in the CTS. Carbon capture and utilisation ( CCU)  plays a

 Page | 102 application within the chemical sector –  varies only slightly, and CO 2 utilisation for producing 
methanol via electrolysis achieves  limited penetration.  
In the CTS, carbon capture and storage ( CCS) deployment increases from almost 3 million  tonnes  
per year ( MtCO 2/yr) in 201 7, related to two existing enhanced oil recovery projects associated 
with ammonia production in the United  States , to around  220 MtCO 2/yr in 2050. A round 
3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide ( GtCO 2) is captured cumulatively by 2050, 1 0% of which is 
captured befor e 2030. The large -scale shift from primary chemical production based on coal to 
natural gas greatly reduces the potential burden placed on carbon capture in the CTS. Capacity  
based on natural gas requires far less carbon capture per unit of primary chemical production.  
 Figure 5.9 • CCU S deployment in the CTS and the RTS  
 
Key message • Additional CO 2 capture capacity deployed in the CTS relative to the RTS is prim arily for 
storage applications.  
Around 40%  of the cumulative CCS capacity in the CTS is deployed to capture concentrated CO 2 
emission streams, with 60%  being applied to dilute streams, most of which arise from energy -
related CO 2 emissions. Concentrated CO 2 streams are captured first, accounting for around 80% 
of cumulative emissions captured before 2030. The fac t that CO 2 separation is an inherent part of 
the production process for methanol and ammonia makes these capture options cheaper and 
therefore more attractive, albeit limited in scope. The only additional capital investment required 
within the production f acility is for CO 2 compression, which involves  less than a fifth of the capital 
cost associated with capture applications for dilute streams in the chemical sector. However, the 
availability  of these more attractive streams is limited.  
After 2030, the feedstock shifts that have taken place,  from coal to natural gas , result  in fewer 
such concentrated streams of emissions being available for capture  for permanent storage , so 
that approximately almost 20 % of CCS is applied to dilute streams  after 2030 . Ammoni a accounts 
for the majority of  the cumulative CCS, both before and after 2030. Methanol accounts for 11% 
of the cumulative captured CO 2 emissions for storage whereas HVCs make up cumulatively 9% of 
total cumulatively CCS by 2050  – only 4% before 2030 . Ammo nia is the only primary chemical for 
which its share of cumulative CO 2 emissions captured for storage is larger before 2030 than aft er. 
This is in part because coal -based capacity which presents a low -cost capture opportunity before 
2030, is phased out by 2050.

Page | 103 CO 2 emission reductions in the CTS. As described in Chapter 2, reductions in emissions can be 
facilitated by utilising a different feedstock, even while remaining within the same family of 
process routes.  
Lighter feedstocks  tend to have higher yields than th eir heavier counterparts, on a mass basis. 
This means fewer tonnes of material need to be processed for a given level of production. If the 
lighter feedstock is replacing a solid ( e.g. switching from coal to natural gas), additional gains are 
achieved thro ugh negating the need to gasify the feedstock.  
For methanol and ammonia, an almost entire shift away from coal, to natural gas and coke oven 
gas, takes place  in the CTS . Whereas ammonia capacity based on coal shrinks to zero, some 
methanol capacity based on coal remains. Newly built MTO plants utilising low -cost methanol 
based on coal are the main incentive for retaining this capacity in 2050. The MTO route becomes 
less attractive as methanol production based on coal disappears, leading the deployment of t his 
process route to decline below the levels seen in the RTS by 2050.  
This dramatically reduces process emissions from the production of these chemicals, but it 
should be noted that this is a one -time emission dividend, and cannot be repeated. As  the majo r 
region for both a mmonia and methanol production and the only region with a large coal- based 
chemical industry, Asia  Pacific  is instrumental in this shift. As with the RTS, in all regions, the use 
of oil products as feedstock for methanol and ammonia is p hased out early in the period to 2050. 
In most cases in the CTS, the shares of various feedstocks for HVC  production do not alter 
dramatically , relative to the RTS.  
Energy efficiency  
As in the RTS, process energy efficiency  improvements are attained both by implementing 
technical  and operational measures to progress towards the best performing technologies , and 
by switching process technology to provide a fundamentally more energy efficient production 
route . For individual technologies, only incremental im provements take place in the CTS, over 
those achieved in the RTS , as process energy efficiency improvements are already well 
incentivised by fuel costs , and further stimulated by the further progressive phase -out of fossil 
fuel subsidies. For most technolo gies, best energy performance lev els are attained approximately 
five-years earlier in the CTS than in the RTS, at the expense of  acceptance of longer payback 
periods for investments in process improvem ents.  
Two  key technology shift s in the CTS are the mov e from coal gasification to natural gas steam 
reforming and  the emergence of naphtha catalytic cracking (NCC). The coal to natural gas 
technology shift goes hand in hand with the accompanying feedstock shift  discussed above, 
complementing the process emissions savings achieved with reductions in energy -related 
emissions. NCC consumes less naphtha, relative to its non -catalytic counterpart, naphtha steam 
cracking. Globally 50 Mt of HVCs  is projected to be produced using this technology in 2050, 
compared with only 8 Mt in the RTS. Deployment of NCC takes place mainly in the Middle  East 
and Asia Pacific  regions.  
Innovative low -CO 2 processes 
Apart from CCUS  (discussed above ), there are two  key groups of innova tive processes that play a 
role in delivering the CO 2 emissions reductions required in the CTS: bioenergy routes  and 
electrolysis . These technologies compete with each other on cost, generally after the maximum 
gains from energy efficiency have been exploi ted, as these tend to be the most economic.  The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8

Key message • Ga s dominates the feedstock mix for ammonia and methanol in the CTS, with ethane and

Bioenergy plays a small role in CO 2 emission reductions in the CTS, both relative to the o ther 
innovative process options  and overall. Bioethylene, produced via ethanol dehydration, is 
deployed at similar levels  relative to overall production , in the CTS and RTS, accounting for less 
than 5% of cumulative HVC  production by 2050. As in the case of the RTS, its deployment is

Page | 105 appreciable levels, reflecting the significant investment cost  and efficiency losses relative to 
traditional routes, even when equipped with carbon capture.  
Electrolysis sees relatively limited deployment  globally , but play s a substantial role in  Europe, 
(and to a more limited extent in Korea and Japan ), where either the legal context for CCUS 
appears unfavourable, or the appetite for alternatives appears strong, even in the face of 
increased costs. In these regions, electrolysis plays a much larger role than CCUS in reducing CO 2 
emissio ns. B y 2050, nearly half of total  ammonia and two-thirds  of methanol is produced via 
electrolysis, whereas less  than 1 0 MtCO 2/yr are captured from all primary chemical produ ction.  
Despite these regional pockets of significant deployment of electrolytic and bioenergy -based 
routes, among innovative low -CO 2 processes, CCUS accounts for the majority of emissions savings 
globally. The limited penetration of electrolytic and bioen ergy -based routes in part reflects the 
fact that a key benefit of these technologies does not accrue to the chemical sector itself – the 
potential to reduce emissions that take place downstream as a result of the fossil -based 
feedstock locked into chemical  products. The technical global potential of b oth bioenergy and 
electrolysis are explored further later in this chapter.  
Environmental benefits in the CTS  
In the CTS, a 45% reduction in chemical sector direct CO 2 emissions  is attained in  2050, relative 
to current levels . Emissions are 6 0% lower in the CTS than in the RTS by 2050 . In cumulative 
terms, the reduction is  5% (or around 1. 2 GtCO 2) by 2030 and 25% (or 1 5 GtCO 2) by 2050, 
compared with the RTS.

 Page | 106 The steepest declines in emissions intensity  are achieved in ammonia production, where 
emissions reduce from 2. 4 tonnes of carbon dioxide per tonne ( tCO 2/t) in 201 7 to 1. 7 tCO 2/t in 
2030 ( almost 30 %) and 0. 5 tCO 2/t in 2050 (80%), meaning that ammonia goes from being the 
most CO 2 emission  intensive p rimary chemical to the least  intensive , among those considered. A 
large contribution to this decarbonisation is made by the almost complete elimination of process 
CO 2 emissions from  ammonia production, which maintain similar levels  in the RTS.  
The CO 2 intensity of methanol production declines steeply  too: by 20% by 2030 and by almost 
60% by 2050. Methanol  production halves  process emission s by 2050  in the CTS , compared with 
a doubling in the RTS. Relative to 201 7, CO 2 emissions from HVC  production are around 20 % 
higher in 2030 and 10% higher in 2050, in the context of 4 5% and 64% increases in production , 
respectively  in the CTS . These figures represent a drop in CO 2 emission s intensity of 83 % by 2030, 
and of 68 % by 2050.  
Emissions of air pollutants plum met across the board in the CTS, with their declines taking similar 
trajectories. Relative to current levels, nitrogen oxides (N Ox) emissions decrease by 38% by 2030, 
and 83% by 2050; sulphur dioxide ( SO 2) by 57% by 2030, and 89% by 2050; and  fine particulate 
matter ( PM 2.5) by 43% by 2030 and 8 4% by 2050.   
The first choices for mitigating air pollutants  are to use  less polluting fuels, increas e energy 
efficiency and , where practicable, to  avoid combustion. When these  options  are exhausted, two 
categories of mitigation technologies for reducing air pollutants from stationary point sources, 
such as  those dedicated to  primary chemical production , remain : advanced  combustion 
technologies and practices, and “ end-of-pipe”  measures.  Both approaches  are deployed  in the 
CTS to reach the level of air pollutant abatement observed.  
Low-NO x burners in process heaters and boilers operate by phasing air and fuel injection to 
achieve lower temperature flames, making use of the fact that there is an exponential (positive) 
relationship between combustion temperatures and thermal generation of NO x. Another 
enhanced combustion opportunity is fluidised -bed technology for solid fuels , which reduc es 
emission s of both SO 2 and NO x.

A final set of mitigation technologies use s chemical products during the production  operation: 
selective catalytic reduction systems (using ammonia) or selective non -catalytic reduction 
systems (using urea) that reduce the NO x in the flue gas to nitrogen and water.   
In the CTS, water pollution from  leakage of waste plastic begins to decline immediately , as a 
result of a strong push by governments to improve waste management systems. Although  
increased recycling  does not necessarily result in lower quantities of plastic waste leakage, the 
waste management infrastructure needed to achieve higher recycling rates –  waste collection, 
sorting etc. –  provides  many of the pre -requisites for mitigating  plastic leakage. I n the CTS, global 
average collection rates for recycling exceed the levels seen in Europe today.

Key message • Cumulative plastic waste leakage more than halves  in the CTS, relative to the RTS.  
Achieving this goal entails a transformation in waste management practices across the globe, 
including widespread waste collection in regions that have poor systems in place at the moment, 
if at all. It also entails the elimination of materials that defy c ollection, such as microbeads and 
ultra- thin plastic films. In the CTS, net annual rates of plastic waste leakage are halved by 2030, 
with steady reductions continuing thereafter. This more than halves the cumulative amount of 
plastic waste leakage by 2050 , relative to the RTS. This near -stabilisation of cumulative leakage 
does not take into account any subsequent efforts to remove plastic waste after leakage occurs, 
for which many proposals and small scale examples exist today.  
In the CTS, annual water  withdrawals  for primary chemical production rise to a lmost  9 billion 
cubic metres ( bcm ) in 2050 , while consumption rises to roughly 3 bcm. Relative to the RTS, total 
cumulative water withdrawals for primary chemical production are 8 % lower, while water 
consum ption is  around  20% lower. Given that indirect withdrawals and consumption account for 
most  of water use in both scenarios, the divergence reflects the different primary chemical 
demand trajectories and different fuels and technologies produced and used in  the power sector 
in the CTS.  
Overall, energy demand is almost 10% lower in the CTS, with coal use in particular around 40% 
lower than in the RTS cumulative ly, with much of this decline occurring in  the Asia Pacific  region, 0100200300400500600

Page | 108 as China shifts away from coal- based chemical processes. While the share of electricity in total 
energy demand is similar in both scenarios, the shift in its composition changes the power 
sector’s water use. The continued shift away from coal and the retirement of existing subcritical 
and supercritical coal power capacity lowers water withdrawals and consumption, while a rise in 
nuclear, bioenergy and concentrated solar power generation increases both.  
 Figure 5.14 • Water  demand for primary chemical  production  by scenario 
Note s: Direct water demand estimates for primary chemical production include water uses as  feedstock (e.g.  steam cracking). Water 
demand for process heating is excluded due to the wide range of possible configurations for steam systems across chemical sit es. 
Key message • In the CTS, water withdrawal for primary chemical production is reduced by almost 30% in 
2050 and water consumption by nearly  45%, relative to the RTS.  
The global trends in water withdrawal and consumption are heavily dependent on developments 
in the Asia  Pacific  region. Water withdrawals for primary chemic al production in Asia Pacific  are 
two-thirds lower in 2050 than in the RTS, while water consumption is almost 60% lower, as the 
amount of electricity and coal used for chemical pr ocesses declines.  
Investments required in  the CTS  
Cumulative investments required by 2050 for the production of primary chemicals in the CTS 
(USD  1.5 trillion ) are marginally lower than in the RTS ( USD  1.7 trillion ). Ammonia offers  the most 
cost- attractive carbon mitigation options among primary chemicals  and thus experiences  the 
steepest rate of decarbonisation in the CTS. Cumulative capital investment in ammonia production is about 15% lower in the CTS than in the RTS , and account s for nearly USD 33 0 billion 
of the total CTS investment. The extra expense of deploying two key carbon emission mitigation 
levers , carbon capture and electrolysis, is more than off-set by the savings on coal -based core 
production equipment, which is entir ely avoided in the CTS. 
Cumulative capital investment in methanol production is nearly 2 0% less in the CTS than in the 
RTS. It accounts for almost 10% ( around USD 1 20 billion) of the cumulative investments in the 
CTS. As with ammonia, the shift from coal to natural gas feedstock leads to core production 
equipment savings that offset the additional expenses incurred for electrolysis and carbon 
capture equipment . Coal- based methanol production, including that required for MTO , accounts 
for almost 50 % of cumul ative production in the RTS compared with less than 3 0% in the CTS. This 
difference reduces cumulative investment in the CTS by roughly USD 40  billion.   03 0006 0009 00012 00015 000

Page | 109  Figure 5.15 • Cumulative capital investment  in the RTS and CTS by primary chemical  
 
Key message • The shift from c oal to natural gas and avoided primary chemical production as a result of 
recycling, offsets the additional investments required for  alternative carbon mitigation . 
HVC  production  accounts for approximately 70% of cumu lative investments in the CTS, around 
6% less than in the RTS, due to lower  production volumes.  In the CTS, plastic recycling results in  
the elimination of around 70  Mt of primary chemical demand  annually by 2050, 9 5% of which are 
HVCs  (the small remainder is made up of both ammonia and methano l).  
 Box 5.2 • Assessing  investments  
Technology selection in the modelling underlying this analysis is based on constrained least -cost optimisation 
covering  energy and investment costs. The investment estimates provided include the capital expenditure on 
core process technology and CO 2 emission mitigation technologies, including carbon  capture, installed 
between 2017 and 2050. The assessment is expenditure based within the sites of primary chemical 
production. Therefore, costs associated with plastic waste collection, sorting , processing and secondary 
production are not included, nor are costs relating to CO 2 transportation and storage. Investments required 
for air pollution mitigation technologies are not included.  Investment costs are not attributed to ene rgy 
savings from improved operation and maintenance practices , unless they require new process equipment. 
Installation, construction an d labour costs are not included since  it is the investments that relate to the 
chemical sector specifically that are rele vant  to this analysis . If included, v ariation in local construction and 
labour practices would cloud the underlying trends , not to mention the greater uncertainty associated with 
such costs . All cumulative investment cost estimates are quoted  in undiscount ed terms.  
 
Consequently, appreciable quantities of production capacity do not need to be constructed and 
maintained. The impact of reducing production has a profound effect in some regions, as the 
most expensive marginal investments are avoided. The savin gs attributable to the avoidance of 
this capacity amount to almost USD 65  billion. Carbon capture equipment in HVC applications 
adds slightly to investment in the CTS, around USD 15  billion.  
Cumulatively around 3 GtCO 2 is captured for storage in the CTS, requiring around  220 MtCO 2/yr 
of capture capacity globally by 2050. Since mi nimal amounts of carbon capture take place in 
the RTS, more than one -third  of the cumulative CO 2 emissions savings in primary chemicals 
between the scenarios are delivered via this lever. Additional cumulative investments for this 
technology in the CTS, excluding transportation and storage infrastructure, amount  to 
approximately USD 6 0 billion.  
Electrolysis -based routes  contribute nearly 4% cumulativ e ammonia and methanol production 
in the CTS, and account for a slightly smaller share of cumulative capital investment.  0 250 500 7501 0001 250

 Page | 110 Electrolysers – the key piece of equipment in electrolytic routes –  undergo a 65% reduction in 
capital cost between 2017 and 2050, and the majority of the deployment of these routes takes 
place in the latter half of the CTS. This results in  comparatively low investment costs per unit of 
production, relative to traditional routes  equipped with CCS . The economic barrier to greater 
uptake of these routes is more to do with the electricity price (a topic explored further later in 
this chapter).   
Because bioenergy play s a similar role per unit of primary chemical output in each scenario, the  
related  investment differences between the two scenarios are small.  
Regional shares of cumulative investment remain very similar in the RTS and CTS. Because 
Asia  Pacific  is the largest producing region, the impact of plastic recyclin g on primary chemical 
demand is felt most keenly there; and  China (in Asia  Pacific ) is the country with the most  of the 
coal -based chemical capacity that shifts towards natural gas in the CTS. Both of these changes 
reduce disproportionately the amount of investment required in the CTS  in Asia  Pacific , 
thereby reducing its share of global cumulative investments very slightly, by 4  percentage 
points.  
 Figure 5.16 • Cumulative  capital  investm ent in primary chemical production by scenario  
 
Note: Vertical bars describe the percentage point change in reg ional share of cumulative investment between the RTS and CTS.  
Key message • Regional investment shares remain broadly unchanged . The impact of recycling and 
switching from coal to natural gas is felt most in Asia  Pacific , reducing its share marginally in t he CTS, 
relative to the RTS.  
Beyond the CTS: A lternative feedstocks  – bioenergy, water and CO 2 
Primary chemicals sourc ed from alternative feedstocks (e.g. bioenergy, water and CO 2) play a 
minor role in the CTS. This section , nonetheless, explore s some of the key technologies that 
would be instrumental and  the challenges faced in displacing all fossil fuel feedstock via these 
routes.  
Why look for alternative feedstocks?  
Chemical feedstock cannot be decarbonised – carbon is required to provid e the s tructure and 
properties of most primary chemicals, and the chemical products they go on to constitute. 
However, the source of the carbon in chemical feedstock need not be derived from fossil fuels. 
Feasible alternative sources include b ioenergy, the hydrogen component of water molecules, CO 2 
that would otherwise be released to the atmosphere , and waste.  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%RTSCTSNorth America

Page | 111 There are two main motivations for limiting the amount of fossil fuels in  chemical feedstock. 
Firstly, process emissions are not insignificant. If process C O2 emissions did not ne ed to be 
mitigated, it would eliminate  the need for approximately 40%  of the CCS deployed in the CTS. 
Direct process CO 2 emissions account for around 14% of cumulative emissions in the RTS  and 
12% in the CTS. When the feedstock is a fossil fuel, this results in a net release of emissions, but if 
the feedsto ck were renewably sourced, the emissions would be neutral on a net basis , if they 
occurred at all.  
Secondly, the carbon atoms embedded in chem ical feedstock lead directly to CO 2 emissions 
during the use and disposal of chemical products downstream. The way that this happens is  
described in more detail in Chapter 3 , but two important sources are  the decomposition of urea, 
which releases most –  if not all –  of the CO 2 that was embedded during its manufacture  and the 
incineration of plastic waste with or without energy recovery, which turns the large carbon 
component of plastics (typically 50 -80% by weight) into CO 2. 
Polyethylene (the largest- volume  plastic resin, accounting for more than a third of plastic 
production) can be used to  give a rou gh sense of scale of the carbon stored in plastics . The total 
volume of polyethylene produced in 201 7 (just over 100  Mt, including high -density polyethylene , 
low-density polyethylene , linear low -density polyethylene ; excluding any additives) contains 
approximately 95 Mt of embedded carbon. If all this plastic were to be combusted, it would 
release approximately 3 40 million  tonnes  of carbon dioxide,  or around a q uarter of the chemical 
sector’s direct CO 2 emissions in 201 7. If this CO 2 were captured, it could theoretically be recycled 
to make new polyethylene or other carbon -containing chemical products.  
How can technology help?  
There are two families of technologies available for producing primary chemicals without reliance 
on fossil fuel feedstock. They use  either electricity or bioenergy. For pathways within these 
families to be classified as renewables , the origin of the electricity and the bioenergy must be 
sustainable. For electricity , possible sources inclu de a raft of conventional and established 
renewable generation technologies such as hydropower, wind and solar. For bioenergy only 
short -cycle carbon sources that are renewably replenished  can be categorised . 
There are three direct routes from bioenergy to primary chemicals: biomass gasification for 
producing both ammonia and methanol, and bioethanol dehydration to produce ethylene. With 
currently demonstrated technology, the propylene and aromatics compon ents of HVCs  then 
need to be produced , using methanol.  
There are a number of existing routes , such as MTO  and MTA  processes, which yield both 
propylene and aromatics via methanol, while  olefin metathesis yields propylene from ethylene 
and butylene. Indire ct routes incur  higher losses , due to the multiple ch emical transformations 
involved;  so research continues to develop both more selective indirect routes, and new direct 
routes where none are currently available.  
Hydrogen- based pathways use hydrogen gener ated via electrolysis ( i.e. water -splitting) , powered 
by renewable electricity. Additional elements , such as carbon and nitrogen , are also required  and 
must either be produced using more renewable electricity (air capture and separation) or be 
captured from a process that would otherwise emit them to the atmosphere. Both ammonia and 
methanol can be produced directly, whereas all HVCs  must be produced indirectly , using the 
array of processes described above for the indirect bioenergy pathways.  The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8

Page | 113 are projected to undergo a 65% decline in capital expenditure (CAPEX) cost between 2017 and 
2050  in both the RTS and CTS. Also during this period, the efficiency obtained rise s from 66% 
today to 82% by 2050 (on a higher heating value (HHV) basis). All othe r technologies are assumed 
to be mature and therefore do not experience any capital cost declines over time.  
As in the discussion of regional cost advantage s in Chapter 2, it is instructive to compare the 
alternative technology pathways with conventional routes. Taking ammonia as an example, for 
which there are direct alternative pathways based on bioenergy and renewable electricity, the 
levelised cost of production via these routes can be compared with the cost of natural gas -based 
production  equipped with CCS.  Energy prices, CAPEX and utilisation rates are sensitive variables, 
and so a range is explored.  
The bioenergy pathway to ammonia is competitive with the electricity pathway only in a very 
limited set  of circumstances, namely when electricity prices are high (more than USD 90/MWh) 
and biomass prices are low (less than USD 8/GJ). Utilisation rates must also be high, as must be 
the CAPEX requirements for electrolysers. This is due to the comparatively high level of CAPEX 
required for biomass gasificatio n (3 -12 times more per unit of ammonia  relative to the 
electrolytic route ) and high energy intensity ( 15-40% more energy -intensive per unit of 
ammonia). It should  be noted that bioenergy utilised to produce ethylene via bioethanol 
dehydration is much more cost competitiv e relative to the other options  and sees some 
deployment in both the RTS and CTS i n certain regions (see Chapters 4 -5). This pathway is much 
more efficient than producing ethylene via the MTO  process . 
The electricity pathway at low utilisation rates , is highly sensitive to CAPEX, and at higher 
utilisation rates , to electricity prices. Given a middling natural gas price of USD 7/MBtu (typical of 
prices in Europe today , but significantly higher than in the United  States and the Middle  East ), 
electrolysis starts to compete with gas -based production equipped with CCS at low electricity 
prices of USD  20-45/MWh , depending on  electrolyser efficiency and CAPEX levels.  This assumes 
both dilute and process emissions streams are captured.  If only the concentrated process 
emissions streams are captured  (and the ammonia is therefore only partly decarbonised) , 
electricity prices must be below USD  20/MWh  for the electricity pathway to compete.  
To put this in to context, average power generation  costs are USD 50 -80/MWh in most regions 
today  and most increase over time in the context of the CTS. Electricity generation costs tend to 
be higher in low-CO 2 scenarios. As  a result, for both concentrated and dilute CO 2 emission 
streams from ammonia plant s, natural gas plants equipped with CCS tend to be a more 
competitive mitigation option over  the vast majority of energy price combinations encountered 
in the CTS . This explains  its considerable  deployment  in that scenario . 
Challenges and opportunities  
The main challenge associated with the idea of providing  primary chemical feedstock  entirely  
via renewable pathways is the large quantities of bioenergy or electricity required. However, 
there are other specific challenges, such as where one would procure the volumes of carbon or 
CO 2 required in what would be a largely decarbonised energy system.  
In this section, a “ what if? ” analysis of each alternative pathway is provided, in order to offer 
some  sense of the main challenges and opportunities associated w ith a ny wide deployment of 
these production routes. None of the figures presented in this section are part of a scenario 
analysis:  they were derived  in isolation. Only the process energy and feedstock used directly 
for primary chemical production are inclu ded. Where necessary, a broad context ( e.g. order of 
magnitude comparisons) and basic inputs ( e.g. primary chemical demand) come  from the CTS.  
Primary chemicals produced in the refining sector are also included in the analysis, as it seems The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8 
Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers  
 Page | 114 unlikely the che mical sector would undergo the fundamental transformations described below, 
while the refining sector remains unchanged.  
In the bio energy pathway, approximately 1 450 million  tonnes  of oil equivalent ( Mtoe ) 
(60 exajoules  (EJ)) of bioethanol and other  assor ted biomass is required by  2030 to meet global 
primary chemical demand  in full, rising to 1  620 Mtoe ( 68 EJ) by  2050. Of this energy input, 
approximately 60% is provided as feedstock (either via gasification or dehydration ) and the 
remainder as process energy (bioenergy used to raise steam and provide process heat)  in 2050 . 
The process energy required to convert methanol into olefins and aromatics  is included . 
If primary chemicals sourced from the refining sector are also included, a further 934  Mtoe 
(39 EJ) by 2030 and 1  003 Mtoe ( 42 EJ) by 2050 are required. To put these figures in to 
perspective, current global primary demand for bioene rgy is 1  350 Mtoe (5 7 EJ). In the CTS , this is 
expected to rise to 1 502 Mtoe ( 63 EJ) by 2040; it  should not ex ceed 3 344 Mtoe (14 0 EJ) in 2050 
if the supply is to remain sustainable (IPCC, 2011) . This pathway would require the use of more 
than half the world’s sustainable biomass supply for primary chemical production.  
 Figure 5.18 • Bioenergy requirements  to satisfy all primary chemical demand  
 
Note s: Primary chemical production  is based on the CTS projection.  The energy required to produce primary chemicals  from refining is 
estimated based on the average energy inte nsity of HVC production in 2017.  
Key message • The equivalent to half the global sustainable biomass supply would be required by 2050 to 
shift fully to bio -based routes for primary chemical produ ction.  
Of the cumulative energy demand for primary chemical production in the bioen ergy pathway, 
approximately one -third is for ammonia and methanol, while two -thirds goes into  HVC  
production. This is not in proportion with production volumes, which are di vided fairly evenl y 
between these two groups. The imbalance occurs because of the need for intermediate 
production of methanol for propylene and aromatics production (this is also an issue for the 
electricity pathway, discussed below) and  the relatively high energy intensity of the  direct bio -
route to ethylene, compared with ammonia and methanol.  
In the electricity pathway, approximately 1  007 Mtoe ( 11 714 terawatt hours  TWh) of electricity 
is required in 2030 to fulfil global primary chemical demand, and 1 025 Mtoe ( 11 922 TWh) in 
2050. Of this energy input, approximately 75 % is consumed by electrolysers (producing 
hydrogen). The remainder is used to convert methanol to HVCs  and to separate air and run the 
synthesis units.  
If primary chemicals sourced from  the refining sector are also included, 1 499 Mtoe ( 17 430 TWh) 
are required by 2030 , increasing to 1 504 Mtoe ( 17 495 TWh) in 2050. To put these figures in  0 5001 0001 5002 0002 5003 000

Page | 115 perspective, current global electrici ty generation is 2  208 Mtoe (2 5 679 TWh). In a CTS context, 
this is expected to rise to more than 3 189 Mtoe (3 7 083 TWh) by 2040.  
The burden of electricity demand is not spread evenly a cross  primary chemicals. Of those 
produced within the chemical sector in the CTS, switching to the renewable electricity pathway is 
most costly in electricity terms for HVCs  – as for bioenergy. Ethylene consumes  almost  twice the 
cumulative energy consumption of ammonia  in 2050, despite being produced in similar volumes. 
BTX aromatics and propylene account for around a quarter of the cu mulative electricity demand, 
but only 17% of cumulative production.  
This imbalance –  between ammonia and methanol, on the one hand and HVCs  on the other –  is 
due to the MTO and MTA conversion process. Two mole cules  of methanol are required for one of 
ethy lene, three f or one of propylene, and six to eight for a mole cule of the aromatics. Some 
2.8 tonnes  of methanol is  required per unit of olefins, and 4.3 per tonne of aromatics. These 
figures may improve as the processes mature, but as it stands these are transformations  
involving  expensive stoichiometry.  
 Figure 5.19 • Electricity requirements to sati sfy all primary chemical demand  
 
Note s: Primary chemical production  is based on the CTS projection.  The energy required to produce primary chemicals from refining is 
estimated based on the average energy intensity of HVC production in 2017.  
Key message • Around 12 000- 17 500 TWh  of renewable electricity would be required to produce all 
primary chemicals via the electricity pathway  in 2050 . Total electricity generation is around 37 000 TWh  
in 2040, two-thirds of which is generated from renewable sources.  
These quantities of electr icity generation would require very substantial capacity investment, as 
all of the electricity would need to be sourced renewably for the pathway to be coherent. With 
the exception of hydro generation, non -bioenergy renewables tend to have a low capacity factor , 
mostly under 50%, and many under 20%. Generating 10  000+  TWh could therefore require many 
times the global capacity of renewable electricity generation  that is currently installed, which 
stood at 2  336 gigawatts .  
Responding to the demand for this quantity of electricity from  a manufacturing industry would 
present an opportunity to enhance flex ibility in the electricity grid: e lectrolysers can be readily 
ramped up and down. Perhaps with the aid of some short term storage, this feature could  
contribute to the response to load shedding (ramping down) or provide additional supply 
(ramping up) when needed by the grid. A more detailed discussion of this complex topic can be

 Page | 116 ways in which this can contribute to complementary s ustainability objectives,  forming a “carbon 
sink”  for other sectors emitting CO 2. To satisfy the demand for methanol and HVCs  via this 
pathway, 1. 5 GtCO 2 would be required in 2030, rising to 1. 6 GtCO 2 in 2050.  
If refineries were  no longer available to pro vide their proportional contribution of primary 
chemical production, these figures would rise to approximately 2. 3 GtCO 2 in 2030 and 2. 6 GtCO 2 
in 2050. To put these quantities in perspective, direct industrial CO 2 emissions from energy -
intensive sectors , excluding the chemical industry, make up around  3.6 GtCO 2 by 2040 in the IEA 
Sustainable Development Scenario  (IEA, 2017). Total direct CO 2 emissions from the chemical 
sector in 201 7 were 1. 5 GtCO 2. 
The specific source of this CO 2 cannot be specified , as this pathway does not identify  the plethora 
of other changes that may take place in the energy system. It may well be the case that if the 
formidable commitment was made to move away from fossil feedstock, the rest of the energy 
system would already b e largely decarbonised. In that case , the carbon locked in chemical 
products could theoretically be continuously recycled, within the chemical sector. This could 
satisfy the demand for carbon only if a) there were no growth in demand for chemical products,  
and b) the carbon could be perfectly extracted and captured from all products, including those 
that disperse during use ( e.g. fertilisers). These conditions seem unlikely to be met, so an external 
carbon source would probably  be needed.

Key message • Some 1 .6 GtCO 2 and 1.7 Gt of feed water would be needed in the renewable electricity 
feedstock pathway by 2050.  
Approximately 30% of the energy inputs in to the bioenergy pathway and 60% in to the electricity 
pathway in 2050 go to produce methanol as an intermediate c hemical for olefins and aromatics.  
By 2050, about 380  Mt of methanol is  required in the bioenergy pathway, and 1  000 Mt ( more 
than total prim ary chemical demand in the CTS)  in the electricity  pathway. These figures differ 
because  ethylene can be produced d irectly from bioenergy, but only indirectly , via methanol,  
when utilising electricity.  
The scale of the industrial activity  required  to produce a n energy -intensive  primary chemical 
merely for intermediate use is a significant disadvantage  of both pathways,  but particularly  so for 
the electricity pathway. Virtually all of this difficulty arises in relation to the production of  HVCs  
(apart from ethylene in the bioenergy pathway), as the production of methanol and ammonia for 
direct consumption does not require  a thermodynamically costly  intermediate step.   0  500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 3 000 3 500 4 000Water

Page | 117 A world in which electricity dis places all other feedstocks for primary chemicals not only 
drastically increases global electricity demand but also direct water consumption in the chemical  
sector. In th e electricity pathway, direct water consumption for the production of primary 
chemicals is approximately two and a half times greater than in the C TS in 2050 . While these 
figures are large relative to the chemical sector’s current consumption, they are no t 
unmanageable in global terms.  
However, the choice of location of electricity -based capacity on this scale would need to take 
careful account of the availability and competition for resources, and the prospects of these 
resources in the future. Water stres s issues could be avoided if electrolysis technologies using sea 
water as a feedstock could be optimised for hydrogen production. Brine electrolysis, used for the 
production of chlorine on an industrial scale, uses concentrated sea water (and the salt it 
contains) as an input. Water desalination and purificatio n are other possibilities that c ould 
facilitate the use of sea water for electrolysis , thereby avoiding contributi ng to water stress.  
Despite not consuming any substantial amount of water directly, a world in which all feedstocks 
are derived from  bioenergy could be even more challenging, in terms of water use,  than the 
electricity pathway . Indir ect water needs for irrigation means that bioenergy has  a high water 
intensity. In addition to the potential impact on water resources, both in terms of quantity and 
quality, questions  also arise regarding the availability of land, potential competition with 
agriculture,  the risks of increased def orestation and soil degradation.   
All of these factors could constr ain a dramatic expansion of bioenergy -based primary chemical 
production. The severity of these factors is  all crop  dependent, with some bioenergy crops 
consuming far less water than others. But whatever the crop , many of the key chemical 
producers, such as  the Middle  East  and China , already  suffer from water constraints and would 
hesitate before becoming over -reliant on biofuels.  Water  imports may be  one option  for reducing 
the local impacts of water stress, but an exporting trade par tner without such const raints may 
not be readily  available.  
Both  of these renewable pathways would improve air pollution , relative to using fossil fuels. 
However,  the electricity pathway is far superior in this regard, as no combustion need take place. 
Water pollution from disposal of end -use product s is, of course, a d ifferent matter. Neither 
pathway  makes a distinct contribution in this respect . Chemical products derived from bioenergy 
are often confused with  those that are biodegradable  (see Box 3.2). But, o nce manufactur ed, the 
primary chemicals , whether  created with electricity or bioenergy as feedstock , are identical in 
composition to their fossil fuel counterparts, despite the differing origins of their carbon and 
hydrogen atoms.

Page | 119 Chapter 6. Eff ecting the transition   
There can be no single prescription  for delivering a sustainable chemical sector. The changes 
envisaged in Chapter 5 and the investments underlying them offer  a practical and economic path  
for the transition. However, they are  unlike ly to be made  without carefully considered policy 
measures.   
An interdisciplinary approach will be required for appropriate interventions throughout the value 
chain , from primary chemical production to waste management . This final chapter defines and 
descr ibes the main areas of policy concerned and the measures that  might be considered. Since  
most policy instruments and interventions must be specific  to the circumstances of a  particular  
locality , crafting individual solutions is largely a matter for national and regional authorities.  
The current landscape for policy makers to survey  
Over the past few decades, the development of the chemical industry has been shaped, 
primarily, by access to advantaged feedstock s and access to growing demand in emergin g 
markets . Today’s circumstances pose an important question as to whether the current recipe for 
success will apply  in the future.  The scope for advantageous access to  feedstock is diminishing.  
Ethane prices are rising in the United  States  as a wave of new  conversion  capacity co mes online 
and a shift to heavier feedstock is already visible in the Middle  East . Competition  in emerging 
markets is increasing. Specialty  chemicals, once  a route to  new sources of high income , are 
becoming commoditised . 
The need to  maintain a competitive edge in the chemical sector has motivated a  swathe of 
merger and acquisition activities in recent years, with record -highs in terms of value reached, in 
2015 and 2016, through a series of mega -deals.  The aggregate deal value almost reached  USD 
150 billion (United  States  dollars) in 2015 and  increas ed to USD 230 billion in 2016, four times 
higher than the level  registered  in 2010 (Deloitte, 2018) .  
While there are many drivers behind this expansion, the basic impetus is either  the need for 
market participants to position themselves early in a growing market segment or the need to 
ensure “portfolio coherence ”. The acquisitio n of Monsanto by Bayer and of Syngenta by 
ChemChina were focus ed, particularly, on the  growing agrichemical market. Other recent 
acquisitions were directed at the growing healthcare and automotive markets.  
Widespread social demand for sustainability require s the industry to elevate the attention given 
to environmental and related considerations. Current modest levels of attainment provide ample 
scope for innovative companies to s eize competitive advantage.  Major chemical companies and a 
number of start -ups are embracing  new business o pportunities in this area. Their efforts rang e 
from the introduction of  technologies that utilise alternative feedstock s to material recycling and 
efficient waste management .  
For example, Total has established a joint venture wi th Corbion that aims to produce a 
biodegradable polymer made from renewable feedstock.  One pilot plant has been built in 
Thailand and another two are planned . Borealis regards the recycling of polyolefins as a strategic 
objective and acquired MTM  plastics, which specialises  in the production of polyolefin recyclate  
from mixed , post -consumer , plastic waste.  
Some start -ups are trying to commercialise processes to convert carbon dioxide ( CO 2) to chemical 
products  and plastic waste to oil products . There is also growing interest from financial investors  
in the  opportunities  in a sustainable chemical value chain. Between 2010 and 2015, venture 
capital investments for material recycling increased five -fold, to around USD 200 million in 2015 . The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8 
Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers  
 Page | 120 The majorit y of these initiatives  aim to accomplish major changes in plast ic waste collection and 
sorting , based on advanced data analytics and robotics (Lux Research, 2016).   
However, since the end of the first clean  tech nology  surge in 2011, alter native chemical 
feedstock start -ups have struggled to attract funding, leading to a n annual  average reduction of 
about 25% in the overall level of funding over the period (Cleantech Group, 2018) . This may 
reflect the difficulty of scaling up enzy matic  conversion technologies  sufficiently quickly to appeal 
to venture capital investors.  
The chemicals industry is also uniquely positioned to offer a range of high -performance materials 
in support of the low-CO 2 transition in other industries , such as buildi ngs, co nsumer goods and 
transportation . Enabling greater penetration of low -CO 2 technologies  and contributing to  energy 
efficiency improvements in other sectors  creates new business opportunities for the chemical 
industry  and benefit s society  as a whole . Widespread political adoption of the sustainability 
agenda means that o ver time, efforts to develop breakthrough technology and capture more 
value  from material efficiency will need to become  embedded  in the method  for value creation  in 
most companies . 
Policy matter s in chemical supply chains  
In industrial supply chains, comparative advantage in production stems partly  from the prevailing 
economic and market  conditions, but it  can also depend on national or regional policy. Prices and 
preferences may all be  influenced by policy makers  and regulatory constraints are manifold . 
Whereas the policy m easures deployed in end -use sectors, such as buildings or transport , often 
have a direct and  traceable set of consequences. But in complex industrial supply chains –  of 
which the chemical sector is a paramount example  – cause and effect  can be difficult to 
distinguish, at least until some time after the measure in question takes effect.  
Impacts of policy behind the factory gate  
A wide array of initiatives to  promote industrial energy efficiency  extend to the chemical  
industry . Important examples include policies and programmes that support or require  the 
adoption of an energy management  system , (such as  that described by the  International 
Organization for Standardization ( ISO) 50001 standard ), and sectoral or company -level targets  
and minimum energy performance standards  (MEPS) for industrial equipment. An energy 
management system is a collection of procedures and practices to ensure the systematic 
planning, a nalysis, control, monitoring and improvement of energy use  and efficiency .  
For example, in Germany large energy -using companies, including chemical manufacturers , can 
obtain sizeable tax reductions by implementing an energy management system. In the 
Unite d States , the voluntary  Superior Energy Performance p rogram me provides recognition, in 
the form of certification, for companies that implement ISO 50001 and achieve energy 
performance improvements.  Adoption of ISO 50001 i s also a component of industrial en ergy 
efficiency policies in Korea, Indonesia, Canada and Mexico and the European  Union .  
Policies that require  companies or industry sectors to reach specified levels of energy efficiency 
or achieve a given level of energy intensity improvement, have been implemented in the People’s 
Republic of China,24 India and Japan. In its 11 th Five Year Plan (20 06-11) China set specific energy 
performance improvement targets  for the top 1 000 energy -consuming enterprises . This 
program me was expanded in the 12 th Five Y ear Plan (2011- 16), with targets set for the t op

Page | 121 10 000 energy consuming enterprises. The target for t he chemical industry was to increase 
output (measured by value) by 8% a year while concurrently decreasing the energy intensity 
(measured by energy demand  per unit of output in terms of value) of production by 18%.   
In India, t he Perform Achieve Trade (PAT) project  requires  designated industrial sectors and 
companies to achieve energy -saving targets and provides a trading mechanism that allows 
companies to trade certificated excess compliance with companies that have not met the targets  
(BEE, 2018). Fertilis er and chlor -alkali  man ufacturers were included in the first PAT cycle 
(2012- 15); 22 companies in the chlor -alkali sector exceeding targeted savings (by 160% ), while  
29 fertilis er producers exceeded their  target (by 70% ). Combined, the two sectors  achiev ed 
almost 1  million  tonnes  of oil equivalent ( Mtoe ) of energy savings , more than 10% of the annual 
process energy demand for primary chemicals production in India (BEE, 2018).  The second PAT 
cycle (2016 -19), again covers these two sectors with an increased  number of companies required  
to meet targets . The list has been extended to  include  refineries,  in which  18 industrial units have  
an energy -redu ction target of 1. 1 Mtoe.   
In 2010, Japan amended its Act on the Rational Use of Energy to introduce mandatory energy 
efficiency thre sholds  in the  form of performance benchmarks and to include an obligation to 
make annual energy efficiency improvement s of 1%. Benchmarks are defined by reference to the 
performance of the top 10 -20% of  companies wi thin each industrial sub -sector.  Companies are 
required to meet performance targets, based on these benchmarks within the medium (five  
years) and long term ( ten years). The policy extends to chemicals , manufacturing and oil refining . 
The European  Union ’s Energy E fficiency Directive contains  a set of binding measures for member 
countries . These are  aimed at providin g a pathway to achieving the European  Union  targets of a 
20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020, further increasing this to 30% by 2030  (both relative to 
business as usual projected energy use) . Progress is tracked at the overall industry level – which 
includes the chemical sector – and has undergone a 1 9% reduction in energy intensity (energy 
input per unit of gross value added generated) between 2005 and 2015 in the European  Union  
(European Union, 2012) . 
Electric motors are an important example of a conversion device used through out the chemical 
industry, where they are used to power pumps, compressors, fans and a multitude of other 
industrial equipment. MEPS are applied to medium -sized electric motors in many major 
economies. However, due to the long operating life of electric mo tors, just over one -quarter of 
global electricity use related to such equipment is covered by MEPS. Across those countries with 
MEPS, if all motors were replaced by motors meeting the standard, that share  would rise to over 
50%, illustrating the broader sc ope of these policies (IEA, forthcoming).  
Supportive interventions do not all stem from governments . For example, i n 1985, the 
International Council of Chemical Associations launched Responsible Care . This is  a voluntary 
commitment to improve and achie ve excellence in environmental and health and safet y 
performance. Responsible Care  commits companies, national chemical industry associations and 
their partners to:  
• continuo usly improve the environmental and health and s afety knowledge and performance 
of tech nologies, processes and products over their life cycles , to avoid har m to people and 
the environment  
• use resources  efficiently and minimise waste  
• report openly on performance , achievements and shortcomings  
• listen, engage and work with people to understand and address their concerns and 
expectations  The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8 
Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers  
 Page | 122 • co-operate with governments and organisations in the development and implementation of 
effective regulations and standards , and to meet or go beyond them  
• provide  help and advice to foster the responsible management of chemicals by all those who 
manage and use them along the product chain.  
To date, there are  580 signatories to the Responsible Care Global Charter, covering 96% of the 
world’s largest chemical compan ies (ICCA and Cefic, 201 8). 
Rational energy pricing  
Energy costs  contribute greatly to the overall costs faced by chemical producers.  As we have 
seen,  costs related to feedstock and process energy account for a bout  80% on average for 
naphtha -based steam cracking  and around 60%  on average for  ethane -based steam cracking (on 
a levelised cost basis). Energy subsidies , which exist for a range of social and industrial reasons, 
many with no particular relevance to the chemical industry,  can l ead to wasteful use of energy 
and be detri mental to energy efficiency investments.  
In the  chemical industry, fossil  fuel subsidies  might also inhibit  shifts towards feedstocks that are 
less carbon intensive or are renewable , if not designed effectively . While coal and natural gas can 
be used inte rchangeably as feedstock or fuel, oil products that are typically demand ed for 
feedstock ( e.g. naphtha and ethane) are rarely consumed solely as fuels, with liquefied 
petroleum gas ( LPG) being an exception.   
Global energy subsidies t otalled USD 26 2 billion  in 2016. The y have been declining since 2012, 
through a combination of decreasing  fuel prices and progress towards subsidy reform. Oil ranks 
second (USD 10 5 billion) and natural gas third (USD 4 9 billion) of global energy subsidies;  
coincidentally, these are the most consumed energy commodities in the chemical sector. 
Although  most of these subsidies were designed  to reduce prices for domestic , rather than 
industrial customers , fossil fuel subsidies can affect  industrial fuel prices directly or indirectly . 
This depend s on whether they are applied to exploration, refining and transformation, or 
consumption activities.  
Natural gas subsidies, where applied to industrial applications, can inhibit efficient use of g as as 
a fuel in industrial activities generally , or as feedstock in the chemical sector. Iran, the Russia n 
Federation25 and the United Arab Emirates together account for around 60% of the global 
natural gas subsidies, while the Middle  East  and Russia are responsible, jointly , for  about a 
third of the global natural gas demand for primary chemicals (including process energy and 
feedstock). Coal subsidies represent less than 1% of the global energy subsidies . The potential 
impact of subsidies on preventing shifts from coal to routes  based on natural gas for primary 
chemicals production or on improving energy ef ficiency in coal -based chemical  production is 
limited.  
Oil subsidies, when applied to oil products consumed as fuels  (e.g. fuel oil or gas oil),  can 
promote wasteful consumpti on whenever  they are used, including in the chemical sector. 
Saudi  Arabia, Iran and China together account for almost half of global oil subsidies, while the 
Middle  East  and China make up 30% of global oil demand for primary chemicals. Saudi  Arabia  
has announced its intention to phase out most fuel subsidies by 2020, ( accompanied by 
measures to support industry with the transition ). In China, oil price reform is progressing 
towards a market -oriented approach integrated  with international ma rket pricing. E arly in 
2015, the excise tax revenue from different Chinese refined oil products increased, including

 Towards more s ustainable plastics and fertilis ers 
    
Page | 123 naphtha (OECD, 2016a) . Reforms on the oil cons umption side in China are com plemented by  a 
reduction in  the subsidies related to  fossil fuel production , including the gradual removal of 
support for shale gas extraction.  
Oil subsidies directly applied to oil products commonly used as chemical feedstock , such as 
ethane or naphtha, are rare . This is  again  because energy subsidies have typically targeted oil 
products that are generally demanded for household or transport -related applications , with the 
objective being to reduce energy poverty, ensure widespread access to energy and redistribute 
wealth.  
Customers for LPG, however, come from both the domestic and the industrial sectors. While LPG 
is essential to facilitate  clean cooking in remote areas  and attracts subsidies primarily for this 
purpose, there can be some spill  over to the industrial sectors . Nevertheless, most untargeted 
LPG subsidies have been removed  or are due to be reformed , which  reinforces the more general 
case for energy price subsidy reform.  
Plastic waste management  
The majority o f the waste that arises from chemical -derived products relates to plastics. There 
are other important chemical products that must be disposed of carefully in order to avoid 
causing environmental damage, such as industrial solvents, paints and surfactants, but the 
bespoke policy measures relevant to these products are outside the scope of this report.  
Where possible, the best waste management policy for plastics is to avoid waste generation in 
the first place.  Where waste generation is unavoidable, well- designed products can reduce  waste 
and costs. It is likely that recycling, incineration and landfill will con tinue to play a combined role 
in waste management options, but attention needs to be given to ensure best pr actice is pursued 
in each  case .  
Design codes and practices  that make it easier for the materials in products to be  extracted and 
sorted after use reduce the need for disposal  and re -manufacture . Examples include the concept 
“design for disassembly ”, which  was proposed  to facilitate re -use and recycling (Talens Peiro, 
Ardent and Mathieux, 2017) . The Eco -design Directive, developed by the European Commission, 
provides  guidance on how to improve the environmental footprint of consumer p roducts in  the 
various phases of their life -cycle  (European Union, 2009) . Indicators  that are evaluat ed under this 
directive cover  energy and  material efficiency indicators, such as recycled content and the waste 
generated when the product is d isposed of. Such indicators help to assess the potential 
environmental damage  of a product , taking account of  its re usability or recyclability.  
Codes and standards can also incentivise p roduct designs that increase the likelihood that a 
material will be recycled (often more than once).  Standards include those that foster t he use of 
simple material mixes  and facilitate the separation of different materials from waste. These 
features result  in plastic resins that can be recovered at greater purity, which increases the 
economic incentive to recycle them for  closely -related  end-use applications (closed loop 
recycling). Alternatively,  if the recycled resin is down -cycled to a lower -grade use th at can 
tolerate a higher level of impurities, the likelihood of recycling  such a resin a second time 
decrease s, especially for uses with stringent specifications ( e.g. food grade applications).  
If the full costs of scrap collection, sorting, cleaning and s econdary production are included, 
recycling plastic s tends to be uneconomic without some form of government support. This 
support is most commonly provided in the form of public waste collection and management 
services. Many municipal governments and local councils across the world provide infrastructure 
and collection services to foster the separation of plastics at the point of disposal ( through the 
use of dedicate d bins and collection routines).  This greatly reduces  the cost of separation at a The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8

support , have delivered steadily increasing rates of recycling. In 2016, recycling overtook landfill 
as a destination for plastic waste for the first time in Europe, while landfill rates in Japan and 
Korea are below 10%.  
Circular economy and resource efficiency  strategies  have been promoted by the European 
Commission, each of which includes aims for the prevention and reduction of waste. New 
measures have been announced recently  in the framework of the Circular Economy Package , 
including a Europe -wide strategy for plastics, which has an  objective that more than half of all 
plastic waste should be  recycled by 2030  (European U nion, 2018a) . As long ago as 2001, Japan 
adopted a resource efficiency -conducive national policy framework , which was supported by  
legislative instruments for waste management (OECD, 2016b) .  
 Box 6.1 • A vision  for Europe’s new plastics economy  
In January 2018, the European Commission announced a  vision for Europe’s new plastic s economy , as part of 
the new set of measures announced within the 2018 Circular Economy Package (European Union, 2018a) . The 
European Strategy for plastics outlines the following  commitments to be implemented : 
• all plastic packaging used in the European market is to be cost -competitively reused  or recycled by 2030 
• more than half of plastic waste gener ated in Europe must be recycled  
• plastic sorting and recycling capacity must be expanded four -fold by 2030,  relative to 2015 levels, 
resulting in 200 000 new jobs  
• some 10 million  tonnes  of recycled plastic is to be used for new products by 2025.  
The key overar ching policy objectives include  reducing Europe’s dependence on imported fossil fuel s, 
decreasing CO 2 emissions, mitigating other environmental effects,  such as plastic leakage, and  incentivising 
economic growth and job creation.  
 
Extended producer responsibility  policies may contain  legal instruments that make producers 
accountable for collecting, sorting and processing products after use . This type of measure is 
already applied in Japan for home appliances, packaging and end -of-life vehicles (OECD, 2016b).  
Green public procurement  policies set criteria that require public purchasing to support 
environmental goals, stimulating innovation and demand for green products. T o be effective, 
these programmes  tend to rely  upon  environmental life-cycle assessment, a  technique  that is 
prone  to boundary and allocation problems.  
Landfill policies  in place in several countries ban or tax waste that is sent to landfill. As of 2016, 
Korea, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Luxembou rg, Belgium, 
Norway and Finland all had  landfill restrictions in place. The se appear to be associated  with 
higher rates of waste -to-energy and recycling for plastic waste (Plastics Europe, 2017) . In stark 
contrast, India is on course to provide new landfills the size of its second largest city, New Delhi, 
by 2050 (The Hindu, 2017) . Like elsewhere in developing economies, this reflects strong 
population growth, increasing urbanisation and rising prosperity , all of which tend to result in 
larger quantities of plastic (and other) waste. Substantial investments in waste collection, 
recycling facilities and waste -to-energy plants are require d to cope with this situation .  
Regional asymmetries with respect to the  generation of waste landfilling and other waste 
management measures have resulted in waste  becoming a globally traded commodity. China’s 
commitment to ban post -consumer plastic waste imports as of 2018 will force  exporting regions 
that previously relied on this relatively cheap outlet for considerable quantities of their plastic © OECD/IEA 201 8 The Future of Petrochemicals

consequence of inc reasing  landfilling, as reported in Australia (Hyam and Roe, 2018) .  
Stopping European plastic waste exports to China will result in an increase of almost 10% in the 
total plastic annual waste volume that needs to be managed domestically. If this were to be fully 
redirected to recycling  (and it is not accounted as such alre ady) , as regulators propose,  it would 
increase European plastic waste recycling by almost 30% (United Nations, 2018a) .26 The 
European Commission recently announced a target  for plastic waste recycling  to reach more than 
50% by 2030  (European Union, 2018a) . 
Motivated largely by recent p ublicity about the devastating extent of plastic pollution, there have 
been calls to ban the consumption of certain plastics . These are particularly for single -use items 
and those for which substitutes exist  (European Union, 2018b) . In the United Kingdom, the 
private sector is preparing to go beyond current poli cy and legislative requirements.  Forty 
businesses  have signed the “ UK Plastic Pact ”, including some major trans -national consumer 
goods manufacturers and retailers. The p act comprises four targets to be achieved by 2025: 
100% of plastic packaging must be reusable, recyclable or compostable; 70% must be e ffectively 
recycled or composted; average recycled content must reach 30%;  and “problematic or 
unneces sary single -use packaging items”  must be eliminated (WRAP, 2018).  The signatories 
estimate that 80% of all plastic packaging for products sold in supermarkets  will be covered by 
the pact.  
At the Europea n Union level, a tax on plastic  consumption is proposed  to encourage recycling, 
reduce waste and to raise revenue (Oettinger, 2018), though  no details of the tax were included 
in the strategy for plastics adopted in January 2018 (European Union, 2018a) . To mitigate the 
damage caused by the microplastics found in cosmetics, about 95 non-governmental 
organisations from around 40 countries and 11 9 manufact urers have joined forces to “ beat  the 
microbead ” (Plastic Soup Foundation, 2018) . This initiative encourages the expectation of 
progressive  phase -out of this particularly perniciou s source o f water pollution.  
  
                                                                                 
26 Estimations based on 2016 statistics. It is unclear as to whether some countries already account for plastic waste exports as  
recycled, assuming they will be at their destination. Where this is the case, redirection will not result in any increase in 
recy cling rates.  The Future of Petrochemicals  © OECD/IEA 201 8

Page | 126 Top ten policy recommendations 
Despite the substantial benefits petrochemical products provide to the world – including a 
growing number of applications in various cutting -edge, clean technologies – the production, 
use, and disposal of petrochemical products pose a variety of sustainability challenges that 
need to be addressed . 
Few policies can be both global in scope and optimally efficient – local circumstances vary too 
much. However, the following ten recommendations warra nt early and consistent attention 
from those intent on contributing to the chemical industry’s transition to a more sustainable future. The ten are divided between production  and use and disposal : 
Production 
1.Directly stimulate investment in RD&D of sustainable chemical production routes and l imit 
associated risks. Unlock finance in areas with potential for sustainable returns, but with a low  
likelihood of attracting, under present circumstances,  independent private investment.
2.Establish and extend plant-l evel benchmarking schemes through public-private co-o perative  
frameworks,  for energy performance,  and CO 2 emission reductions targets,  and incentivise 
their adoption through fiscal incentives.
3.Pursue effective r egulatory actions to r educe CO 2 emissions. These need to include support  
to avoid the i mpact of asymmetric regional pricing pressures and targeted support to spur the  
creation of initial niche markets where necessary.
4.Require industry to meet stringent air quality standards, such as those of the World Health  
Organization, by developing and installing air pollution control technologies, fuel shifts, and  
improved fuel quality.
5.Fuel and feedstock prices should reflect actual market value, specifically those that delay  
investment in energy efficiency. Ensure that fuel subsidies designed to facilitate clean energy  
access (e.g. subsidies for liquefied petroleum gas for clean cooking) are precisely targeted and  
do not inhibit shifts towards alternative chemical feedstocks. 
Use and disposal  
1.Reduce reliance on sing le-use plastics  other than for essential non-substitutable functions.
Policy mechanisms include introducing deposit -return systems for reusable goods
(e.g.  beverage containers) or fiscal instruments (such as a revenue -neutral plastic
consumption tax , the proceeds of which could be directed to preventing and mitigating plastic
pollution ).
2.Improve waste management  practice around the world, both to increase recycling and to
drastically reduce plastic waste leakage. Examples include prohibiting or implementing a tax
on the disposal in landfills of all recoverable waste and improving the separation and
collection of recyclables at source.
3.Raise consumer awareness  about the multiple benefits of recycling consumer goods, the
environmental ills associated with poo r waste management, and the most effective policy
interventions.
4.Design  products  with disposal in mind by incentivising designers and manufacturers
downstream of chemical producers  to adopt  designs that  optimise the use of materials,
enable reuse, and  facilitate closed -loop recycling .© OECD/IEA 201 8 The Future of Petrochemicals  
 Towards more s ustainable plastics and fertilis ers 
    
Page | 127 5. Extend producer responsibility  beyond production to appropriate aspects of the use and 
disposal of chemical products, for example, through systems that levy fees penalising the 
limited recyclability of a material and actions that complicate waste separation.  
Keeping these policy strategies on course, monitoring , and evaluating their progress and 
effectively communicating their results require reliable, transparent , and timely data. A clear 
institutional framework defining responsibilities for stakeholders throughout the value chain – 
from chemical production through to the use and disposal of chemical products –  will be a pre -
requisite for ensuring cost -efficient, concerted action.
